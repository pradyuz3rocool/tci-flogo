<span id="L17" class="ln">    17</span>	
<span id="L18" class="ln">    18</span>	MOST of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or
<span id="L19" class="ln">    19</span>	two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were
<span id="L20" class="ln">    20</span>	schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but
<span id="L21" class="ln">    21</span>	not from an individual--he is a combination of the characteristics of
<span id="L22" class="ln">    22</span>	three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of
<span id="L23" class="ln">    23</span>	architecture.
<span id="L24" class="ln">    24</span>	
<span id="L25" class="ln">    25</span>	The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children
<span id="L26" class="ln">    26</span>	and slaves in the West at the period of this story--that is to say,
<span id="L27" class="ln">    27</span>	thirty or forty years ago.
<span id="L28" class="ln">    28</span>	
<span id="L29" class="ln">    29</span>	Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
<span id="L30" class="ln">    30</span>	girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,
<span id="L31" class="ln">    31</span>	for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what
<span id="L32" class="ln">    32</span>	they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,
<span id="L33" class="ln">    33</span>	and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.

<span id="L49" class="ln">    49</span>	No answer.
<span id="L50" class="ln">    50</span>	
<span id="L51" class="ln">    51</span>	&#34;TOM!&#34;
<span id="L52" class="ln">    52</span>	
<span id="L53" class="ln">    53</span>	No answer.
<span id="L54" class="ln">    54</span>	
<span id="L55" class="ln">    55</span>	&#34;What&#39;s gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!&#34;
<span id="L56" class="ln">    56</span>	
<span id="L57" class="ln">    57</span>	No answer.
<span id="L58" class="ln">    58</span>	
<span id="L59" class="ln">    59</span>	The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
<span id="L60" class="ln">    60</span>	room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or
<span id="L61" class="ln">    61</span>	never looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her
<span id="L62" class="ln">    62</span>	state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for &#34;style,&#34; not
<span id="L63" class="ln">    63</span>	service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.
<span id="L64" class="ln">    64</span>	She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but
<span id="L65" class="ln">    65</span>	still loud enough for the furniture to hear:
<span id="L66" class="ln">    66</span>	
<span id="L67" class="ln">    67</span>	&#34;Well, I lay if I get hold of you I&#39;ll--&#34;
<span id="L68" class="ln">    68</span>	
<span id="L69" class="ln">    69</span>	She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
<span id="L70" class="ln">    70</span>	under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
<span id="L71" class="ln">    71</span>	punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.
<span id="L72" class="ln">    72</span>	
<span id="L73" class="ln">    73</span>	&#34;I never did see the beat of that boy!&#34;
<span id="L74" class="ln">    74</span>	
<span id="L75" class="ln">    75</span>	She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
<span id="L76" class="ln">    76</span>	tomato vines and &#34;jimpson&#34; weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom.
<span id="L77" class="ln">    77</span>	So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and
<span id="L78" class="ln">    78</span>	shouted:
<span id="L79" class="ln">    79</span>	
<span id="L80" class="ln">    80</span>	&#34;Y-o-u-u TOM!&#34;
<span id="L81" class="ln">    81</span>	
<span id="L82" class="ln">    82</span>	There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to
<span id="L83" class="ln">    83</span>	seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
<span id="L84" class="ln">    84</span>	
<span id="L85" class="ln">    85</span>	&#34;There! I might &#39;a&#39; thought of that closet. What you been doing in
<span id="L86" class="ln">    86</span>	there?&#34;
<span id="L87" class="ln">    87</span>	
<span id="L88" class="ln">    88</span>	&#34;Nothing.&#34;
<span id="L89" class="ln">    89</span>	
<span id="L90" class="ln">    90</span>	&#34;Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS that
<span id="L91" class="ln">    91</span>	truck?&#34;
<span id="L92" class="ln">    92</span>	
<span id="L93" class="ln">    93</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t know, aunt.&#34;
<span id="L94" class="ln">    94</span>	
<span id="L95" class="ln">    95</span>	&#34;Well, I know. It&#39;s jam--that&#39;s what it is. Forty times I&#39;ve said if
<span id="L96" class="ln">    96</span>	you didn&#39;t let that jam alone I&#39;d skin you. Hand me that switch.&#34;
<span id="L97" class="ln">    97</span>	
<span id="L98" class="ln">    98</span>	The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--
<span id="L99" class="ln">    99</span>	
<span id="L100" class="ln">   100</span>	&#34;My! Look behind you, aunt!&#34;
<span id="L101" class="ln">   101</span>	
<span id="L102" class="ln">   102</span>	The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The
<span id="L103" class="ln">   103</span>	lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
<span id="L104" class="ln">   104</span>	disappeared over it.
<span id="L105" class="ln">   105</span>	
<span id="L106" class="ln">   106</span>	His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
<span id="L107" class="ln">   107</span>	laugh.
<span id="L108" class="ln">   108</span>	
<span id="L109" class="ln">   109</span>	&#34;Hang the boy, can&#39;t I never learn anything? Ain&#39;t he played me tricks
<span id="L110" class="ln">   110</span>	enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
<span id="L111" class="ln">   111</span>	fools is the biggest fools there is. Can&#39;t learn an old dog new tricks,
<span id="L112" class="ln">   112</span>	as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
<span id="L113" class="ln">   113</span>	and how is a body to know what&#39;s coming? He &#39;pears to know just how
<span id="L114" class="ln">   114</span>	long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he
<span id="L115" class="ln">   115</span>	can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it&#39;s all down
<span id="L116" class="ln">   116</span>	again and I can&#39;t hit him a lick. I ain&#39;t doing my duty by that boy,
<span id="L117" class="ln">   117</span>	and that&#39;s the Lord&#39;s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile
<span id="L118" class="ln">   118</span>	the child, as the Good Book says. I&#39;m a laying up sin and suffering for
<span id="L119" class="ln">   119</span>	us both, I know. He&#39;s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he&#39;s my
<span id="L120" class="ln">   120</span>	own dead sister&#39;s boy, poor thing, and I ain&#39;t got the heart to lash
<span id="L121" class="ln">   121</span>	him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so,
<span id="L122" class="ln">   122</span>	and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man
<span id="L123" class="ln">   123</span>	that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the
<span id="L124" class="ln">   124</span>	Scripture says, and I reckon it&#39;s so. He&#39;ll play hookey this evening, *
<span id="L125" class="ln">   125</span>	and [* Southwestern for &#34;afternoon&#34;] I&#39;ll just be obleeged to make him
<span id="L126" class="ln">   126</span>	work, to-morrow, to punish him. It&#39;s mighty hard to make him work
<span id="L127" class="ln">   127</span>	Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more
<span id="L128" class="ln">   128</span>	than he hates anything else, and I&#39;ve GOT to do some of my duty by him,
<span id="L129" class="ln">   129</span>	or I&#39;ll be the ruination of the child.&#34;
<span id="L130" class="ln">   130</span>	
<span id="L131" class="ln">   131</span>	Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home
<span id="L132" class="ln">   132</span>	barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day&#39;s
<span id="L133" class="ln">   133</span>	wood and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in
<span id="L134" class="ln">   134</span>	time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the
<span id="L135" class="ln">   135</span>	work. Tom&#39;s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already
<span id="L136" class="ln">   136</span>	through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a
<span id="L137" class="ln">   137</span>	quiet boy, and had no adventurous, troublesome ways.
<span id="L138" class="ln">   138</span>	
<span id="L139" class="ln">   139</span>	While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
<span id="L140" class="ln">   140</span>	offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
<span id="L141" class="ln">   141</span>	very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like
<span id="L142" class="ln">   142</span>	many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
<span id="L143" class="ln">   143</span>	was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
<span id="L144" class="ln">   144</span>	loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
<span id="L145" class="ln">   145</span>	cunning. Said she:
<span id="L146" class="ln">   146</span>	
<span id="L147" class="ln">   147</span>	&#34;Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn&#39;t it?&#34;
<span id="L148" class="ln">   148</span>	
<span id="L149" class="ln">   149</span>	&#34;Yes&#39;m.&#34;
<span id="L150" class="ln">   150</span>	
<span id="L151" class="ln">   151</span>	&#34;Powerful warm, warn&#39;t it?&#34;
<span id="L152" class="ln">   152</span>	
<span id="L153" class="ln">   153</span>	&#34;Yes&#39;m.&#34;
<span id="L154" class="ln">   154</span>	
<span id="L155" class="ln">   155</span>	&#34;Didn&#39;t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L156" class="ln">   156</span>	
<span id="L157" class="ln">   157</span>	A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.
<span id="L158" class="ln">   158</span>	He searched Aunt Polly&#39;s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:
<span id="L159" class="ln">   159</span>	
<span id="L160" class="ln">   160</span>	&#34;No&#39;m--well, not very much.&#34;
<span id="L161" class="ln">   161</span>	
<span id="L162" class="ln">   162</span>	The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom&#39;s shirt, and said:
<span id="L163" class="ln">   163</span>	
<span id="L164" class="ln">   164</span>	&#34;But you ain&#39;t too warm now, though.&#34; And it flattered her to reflect
<span id="L165" class="ln">   165</span>	that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
<span id="L166" class="ln">   166</span>	that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew
<span id="L167" class="ln">   167</span>	where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:
<span id="L168" class="ln">   168</span>	
<span id="L169" class="ln">   169</span>	&#34;Some of us pumped on our heads--mine&#39;s damp yet. See?&#34;
<span id="L170" class="ln">   170</span>	
<span id="L171" class="ln">   171</span>	Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
<span id="L172" class="ln">   172</span>	circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
<span id="L173" class="ln">   173</span>	inspiration:
<span id="L174" class="ln">   174</span>	
<span id="L175" class="ln">   175</span>	&#34;Tom, you didn&#39;t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to
<span id="L176" class="ln">   176</span>	pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!&#34;
<span id="L177" class="ln">   177</span>	
<span id="L178" class="ln">   178</span>	The trouble vanished out of Tom&#39;s face. He opened his jacket. His
<span id="L179" class="ln">   179</span>	shirt collar was securely sewed.
<span id="L180" class="ln">   180</span>	
<span id="L181" class="ln">   181</span>	&#34;Bother! Well, go &#39;long with you. I&#39;d made sure you&#39;d played hookey
<span id="L182" class="ln">   182</span>	and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you&#39;re a kind of a
<span id="L183" class="ln">   183</span>	singed cat, as the saying is--better&#39;n you look. THIS time.&#34;
<span id="L184" class="ln">   184</span>	
<span id="L185" class="ln">   185</span>	She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
<span id="L186" class="ln">   186</span>	had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.
<span id="L187" class="ln">   187</span>	
<span id="L188" class="ln">   188</span>	But Sidney said:
<span id="L189" class="ln">   189</span>	
<span id="L190" class="ln">   190</span>	&#34;Well, now, if I didn&#39;t think you sewed his collar with white thread,
<span id="L191" class="ln">   191</span>	but it&#39;s black.&#34;
<span id="L192" class="ln">   192</span>	
<span id="L193" class="ln">   193</span>	&#34;Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!&#34;
<span id="L194" class="ln">   194</span>	
<span id="L195" class="ln">   195</span>	But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:
<span id="L196" class="ln">   196</span>	
<span id="L197" class="ln">   197</span>	&#34;Siddy, I&#39;ll lick you for that.&#34;
<span id="L198" class="ln">   198</span>	
<span id="L199" class="ln">   199</span>	In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
<span id="L200" class="ln">   200</span>	the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle
<span id="L201" class="ln">   201</span>	carried white thread and the other black. He said:
<span id="L202" class="ln">   202</span>	
<span id="L203" class="ln">   203</span>	&#34;She&#39;d never noticed if it hadn&#39;t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes
<span id="L204" class="ln">   204</span>	she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
<span id="L205" class="ln">   205</span>	geeminy she&#39;d stick to one or t&#39;other--I can&#39;t keep the run of &#39;em. But
<span id="L206" class="ln">   206</span>	I bet you I&#39;ll lam Sid for that. I&#39;ll learn him!&#34;
<span id="L207" class="ln">   207</span>	
<span id="L208" class="ln">   208</span>	He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very
<span id="L209" class="ln">   209</span>	well though--and loathed him.
<span id="L210" class="ln">   210</span>	
<span id="L211" class="ln">   211</span>	Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles.
<span id="L212" class="ln">   212</span>	Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him
<span id="L213" class="ln">   213</span>	than a man&#39;s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
<span id="L214" class="ln">   214</span>	them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men&#39;s
<span id="L215" class="ln">   215</span>	misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This
<span id="L216" class="ln">   216</span>	new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just
<span id="L217" class="ln">   217</span>	acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed.
<span id="L218" class="ln">   218</span>	It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
<span id="L219" class="ln">   219</span>	produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
<span id="L220" class="ln">   220</span>	intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how
<span id="L221" class="ln">   221</span>	to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave
<span id="L222" class="ln">   222</span>	him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full
<span id="L223" class="ln">   223</span>	of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an
<span id="L224" class="ln">   224</span>	astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as
<span id="L225" class="ln">   225</span>	strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with
<span id="L226" class="ln">   226</span>	the boy, not the astronomer.
<span id="L227" class="ln">   227</span>	
<span id="L228" class="ln">   228</span>	The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
<span id="L229" class="ln">   229</span>	checked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger
<span id="L230" class="ln">   230</span>	than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive
<span id="L231" class="ln">   231</span>	curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy
<span id="L232" class="ln">   232</span>	was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply
<span id="L233" class="ln">   233</span>	astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
<span id="L234" class="ln">   234</span>	roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes
<span id="L235" class="ln">   235</span>	on--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
<span id="L236" class="ln">   236</span>	ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom&#39;s vitals. The
<span id="L237" class="ln">   237</span>	more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his
<span id="L238" class="ln">   238</span>	nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed
<span id="L239" class="ln">   239</span>	to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but
<span id="L240" class="ln">   240</span>	only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all
<span id="L241" class="ln">   241</span>	the time. Finally Tom said:
<span id="L242" class="ln">   242</span>	
<span id="L243" class="ln">   243</span>	&#34;I can lick you!&#34;
<span id="L244" class="ln">   244</span>	
<span id="L245" class="ln">   245</span>	&#34;I&#39;d like to see you try it.&#34;
<span id="L246" class="ln">   246</span>	
<span id="L247" class="ln">   247</span>	&#34;Well, I can do it.&#34;
<span id="L248" class="ln">   248</span>	
<span id="L249" class="ln">   249</span>	&#34;No you can&#39;t, either.&#34;
<span id="L250" class="ln">   250</span>	
<span id="L251" class="ln">   251</span>	&#34;Yes I can.&#34;
<span id="L252" class="ln">   252</span>	
<span id="L253" class="ln">   253</span>	&#34;No you can&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L254" class="ln">   254</span>	
<span id="L255" class="ln">   255</span>	&#34;I can.&#34;
<span id="L256" class="ln">   256</span>	
<span id="L257" class="ln">   257</span>	&#34;You can&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L258" class="ln">   258</span>	
<span id="L259" class="ln">   259</span>	&#34;Can!&#34;
<span id="L260" class="ln">   260</span>	
<span id="L261" class="ln">   261</span>	&#34;Can&#39;t!&#34;
<span id="L262" class="ln">   262</span>	
<span id="L263" class="ln">   263</span>	An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:
<span id="L264" class="ln">   264</span>	
<span id="L265" class="ln">   265</span>	&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;
<span id="L266" class="ln">   266</span>	
<span id="L267" class="ln">   267</span>	&#34;&#39;Tisn&#39;t any of your business, maybe.&#34;
<span id="L268" class="ln">   268</span>	
<span id="L269" class="ln">   269</span>	&#34;Well I &#39;low I&#39;ll MAKE it my business.&#34;
<span id="L270" class="ln">   270</span>	
<span id="L271" class="ln">   271</span>	&#34;Well why don&#39;t you?&#34;
<span id="L272" class="ln">   272</span>	
<span id="L273" class="ln">   273</span>	&#34;If you say much, I will.&#34;
<span id="L274" class="ln">   274</span>	
<span id="L275" class="ln">   275</span>	&#34;Much--much--MUCH. There now.&#34;
<span id="L276" class="ln">   276</span>	
<span id="L277" class="ln">   277</span>	&#34;Oh, you think you&#39;re mighty smart, DON&#39;T you? I could lick you with
<span id="L278" class="ln">   278</span>	one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.&#34;
<span id="L279" class="ln">   279</span>	
<span id="L280" class="ln">   280</span>	&#34;Well why don&#39;t you DO it? You SAY you can do it.&#34;
<span id="L281" class="ln">   281</span>	
<span id="L282" class="ln">   282</span>	&#34;Well I WILL, if you fool with me.&#34;
<span id="L283" class="ln">   283</span>	
<span id="L284" class="ln">   284</span>	&#34;Oh yes--I&#39;ve seen whole families in the same fix.&#34;
<span id="L285" class="ln">   285</span>	
<span id="L286" class="ln">   286</span>	&#34;Smarty! You think you&#39;re SOME, now, DON&#39;T you? Oh, what a hat!&#34;
<span id="L287" class="ln">   287</span>	
<span id="L288" class="ln">   288</span>	&#34;You can lump that hat if you don&#39;t like it. I dare you to knock it
<span id="L289" class="ln">   289</span>	off--and anybody that&#39;ll take a dare will suck eggs.&#34;
<span id="L290" class="ln">   290</span>	
<span id="L291" class="ln">   291</span>	&#34;You&#39;re a liar!&#34;
<span id="L292" class="ln">   292</span>	
<span id="L293" class="ln">   293</span>	&#34;You&#39;re another.&#34;
<span id="L294" class="ln">   294</span>	
<span id="L295" class="ln">   295</span>	&#34;You&#39;re a fighting liar and dasn&#39;t take it up.&#34;
<span id="L296" class="ln">   296</span>	
<span id="L297" class="ln">   297</span>	&#34;Aw--take a walk!&#34;
<span id="L298" class="ln">   298</span>	
<span id="L299" class="ln">   299</span>	&#34;Say--if you give me much more of your sass I&#39;ll take and bounce a
<span id="L300" class="ln">   300</span>	rock off&#39;n your head.&#34;
<span id="L301" class="ln">   301</span>	
<span id="L302" class="ln">   302</span>	&#34;Oh, of COURSE you will.&#34;
<span id="L303" class="ln">   303</span>	
<span id="L304" class="ln">   304</span>	&#34;Well I WILL.&#34;
<span id="L305" class="ln">   305</span>	
<span id="L306" class="ln">   306</span>	&#34;Well why don&#39;t you DO it then? What do you keep SAYING you will for?
<span id="L307" class="ln">   307</span>	Why don&#39;t you DO it? It&#39;s because you&#39;re afraid.&#34;
<span id="L308" class="ln">   308</span>	
<span id="L309" class="ln">   309</span>	&#34;I AIN&#39;T afraid.&#34;
<span id="L310" class="ln">   310</span>	
<span id="L311" class="ln">   311</span>	&#34;You are.&#34;
<span id="L312" class="ln">   312</span>	
<span id="L313" class="ln">   313</span>	&#34;I ain&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L314" class="ln">   314</span>	
<span id="L315" class="ln">   315</span>	&#34;You are.&#34;
<span id="L316" class="ln">   316</span>	
<span id="L317" class="ln">   317</span>	Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
<span id="L318" class="ln">   318</span>	they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:
<span id="L319" class="ln">   319</span>	
<span id="L320" class="ln">   320</span>	&#34;Get away from here!&#34;
<span id="L321" class="ln">   321</span>	
<span id="L322" class="ln">   322</span>	&#34;Go away yourself!&#34;
<span id="L323" class="ln">   323</span>	
<span id="L324" class="ln">   324</span>	&#34;I won&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L325" class="ln">   325</span>	
<span id="L326" class="ln">   326</span>	&#34;I won&#39;t either.&#34;
<span id="L327" class="ln">   327</span>	
<span id="L328" class="ln">   328</span>	So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and
<span id="L329" class="ln">   329</span>	both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with
<span id="L330" class="ln">   330</span>	hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both
<span id="L331" class="ln">   331</span>	were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution,
<span id="L332" class="ln">   332</span>	and Tom said:
<span id="L333" class="ln">   333</span>	
<span id="L334" class="ln">   334</span>	&#34;You&#39;re a coward and a pup. I&#39;ll tell my big brother on you, and he
<span id="L335" class="ln">   335</span>	can thrash you with his little finger, and I&#39;ll make him do it, too.&#34;
<span id="L336" class="ln">   336</span>	
<span id="L337" class="ln">   337</span>	&#34;What do I care for your big brother? I&#39;ve got a brother that&#39;s bigger
<span id="L338" class="ln">   338</span>	than he is--and what&#39;s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.&#34;
<span id="L339" class="ln">   339</span>	[Both brothers were imaginary.]
<span id="L340" class="ln">   340</span>	
<span id="L341" class="ln">   341</span>	&#34;That&#39;s a lie.&#34;
<span id="L342" class="ln">   342</span>	
<span id="L343" class="ln">   343</span>	&#34;YOUR saying so don&#39;t make it so.&#34;
<span id="L344" class="ln">   344</span>	
<span id="L345" class="ln">   345</span>	Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:
<span id="L346" class="ln">   346</span>	
<span id="L347" class="ln">   347</span>	&#34;I dare you to step over that, and I&#39;ll lick you till you can&#39;t stand
<span id="L348" class="ln">   348</span>	up. Anybody that&#39;ll take a dare will steal sheep.&#34;
<span id="L349" class="ln">   349</span>	
<span id="L350" class="ln">   350</span>	The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:
<span id="L351" class="ln">   351</span>	
<span id="L352" class="ln">   352</span>	&#34;Now you said you&#39;d do it, now let&#39;s see you do it.&#34;
<span id="L353" class="ln">   353</span>	
<span id="L354" class="ln">   354</span>	&#34;Don&#39;t you crowd me now; you better look out.&#34;
<span id="L355" class="ln">   355</span>	
<span id="L356" class="ln">   356</span>	&#34;Well, you SAID you&#39;d do it--why don&#39;t you do it?&#34;
<span id="L357" class="ln">   357</span>	
<span id="L358" class="ln">   358</span>	&#34;By jingo! for two cents I WILL do it.&#34;
<span id="L359" class="ln">   359</span>	
<span id="L360" class="ln">   360</span>	The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
<span id="L361" class="ln">   361</span>	with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
<span id="L362" class="ln">   362</span>	were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
<span id="L363" class="ln">   363</span>	for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other&#39;s hair and
<span id="L364" class="ln">   364</span>	clothes, punched and scratched each other&#39;s nose, and covered
<span id="L365" class="ln">   365</span>	themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and
<span id="L366" class="ln">   366</span>	through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and
<span id="L367" class="ln">   367</span>	pounding him with his fists. &#34;Holler &#39;nuff!&#34; said he.
<span id="L368" class="ln">   368</span>	
<span id="L369" class="ln">   369</span>	The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.
<span id="L370" class="ln">   370</span>	
<span id="L371" class="ln">   371</span>	&#34;Holler &#39;nuff!&#34;--and the pounding went on.
<span id="L372" class="ln">   372</span>	
<span id="L373" class="ln">   373</span>	At last the stranger got out a smothered &#34;&#39;Nuff!&#34; and Tom let him up
<span id="L374" class="ln">   374</span>	and said:
<span id="L375" class="ln">   375</span>	
<span id="L376" class="ln">   376</span>	&#34;Now that&#39;ll learn you. Better look out who you&#39;re fooling with next
<span id="L377" class="ln">   377</span>	time.&#34;
<span id="L378" class="ln">   378</span>	
<span id="L379" class="ln">   379</span>	The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
<span id="L380" class="ln">   380</span>	snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
<span id="L381" class="ln">   381</span>	threatening what he would do to Tom the &#34;next time he caught him out.&#34;
<span id="L382" class="ln">   382</span>	To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
<span id="L383" class="ln">   383</span>	as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw
<span id="L384" class="ln">   384</span>	it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
<span id="L385" class="ln">   385</span>	an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
<span id="L386" class="ln">   386</span>	lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
<span id="L387" class="ln">   387</span>	enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
<span id="L388" class="ln">   388</span>	window and declined. At last the enemy&#39;s mother appeared, and called
<span id="L389" class="ln">   389</span>	Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went
<span id="L390" class="ln">   390</span>	away; but he said he &#34;&#39;lowed&#34; to &#34;lay&#34; for that boy.
<span id="L391" class="ln">   391</span>	
<span id="L392" class="ln">   392</span>	He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
<span id="L393" class="ln">   393</span>	at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;
<span id="L394" class="ln">   394</span>	and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn
<span id="L395" class="ln">   395</span>	his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in
<span id="L396" class="ln">   396</span>	its firmness.
<span id="L397" class="ln">   397</span>	
<span id="L398" class="ln">   398</span>	
<span id="L399" class="ln">   399</span>	
<span id="L400" class="ln">   400</span>	CHAPTER II
<span id="L401" class="ln">   401</span>	
<span id="L402" class="ln">   402</span>	SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
<span id="L403" class="ln">   403</span>	fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
<span id="L404" class="ln">   404</span>	the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
<span id="L405" class="ln">   405</span>	every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
<span id="L406" class="ln">   406</span>	and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
<span id="L407" class="ln">   407</span>	the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
<span id="L408" class="ln">   408</span>	enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
<span id="L409" class="ln">   409</span>	
<span id="L410" class="ln">   410</span>	Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
<span id="L411" class="ln">   411</span>	long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
<span id="L412" class="ln">   412</span>	a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
<span id="L413" class="ln">   413</span>	fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
<span id="L414" class="ln">   414</span>	burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
<span id="L415" class="ln">   415</span>	plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
<span id="L416" class="ln">   416</span>	whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
<span id="L417" class="ln">   417</span>	fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
<span id="L418" class="ln">   418</span>	the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from
<span id="L419" class="ln">   419</span>	the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom&#39;s eyes, before, but
<span id="L420" class="ln">   420</span>	now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
<span id="L421" class="ln">   421</span>	the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
<span id="L422" class="ln">   422</span>	waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling,
<span id="L423" class="ln">   423</span>	fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only
<span id="L424" class="ln">   424</span>	a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of
<span id="L425" class="ln">   425</span>	water under an hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after
<span id="L426" class="ln">   426</span>	him. Tom said:
<span id="L427" class="ln">   427</span>	
<span id="L428" class="ln">   428</span>	&#34;Say, Jim, I&#39;ll fetch the water if you&#39;ll whitewash some.&#34;
<span id="L429" class="ln">   429</span>	
<span id="L430" class="ln">   430</span>	Jim shook his head and said:
<span id="L431" class="ln">   431</span>	
<span id="L432" class="ln">   432</span>	&#34;Can&#39;t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an&#39; git dis
<span id="L433" class="ln">   433</span>	water an&#39; not stop foolin&#39; roun&#39; wid anybody. She say she spec&#39; Mars
<span id="L434" class="ln">   434</span>	Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an&#39; so she tole me go &#39;long an&#39; &#39;tend
<span id="L435" class="ln">   435</span>	to my own business--she &#39;lowed SHE&#39;D &#39;tend to de whitewashin&#39;.&#34;
<span id="L436" class="ln">   436</span>	
<span id="L437" class="ln">   437</span>	&#34;Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That&#39;s the way she always
<span id="L438" class="ln">   438</span>	talks. Gimme the bucket--I won&#39;t be gone only a a minute. SHE won&#39;t
<span id="L439" class="ln">   439</span>	ever know.&#34;
<span id="L440" class="ln">   440</span>	
<span id="L441" class="ln">   441</span>	&#34;Oh, I dasn&#39;t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she&#39;d take an&#39; tar de head off&#39;n
<span id="L442" class="ln">   442</span>	me. &#39;Deed she would.&#34;
<span id="L443" class="ln">   443</span>	
<span id="L444" class="ln">   444</span>	&#34;SHE! She never licks anybody--whacks &#39;em over the head with her
<span id="L445" class="ln">   445</span>	thimble--and who cares for that, I&#39;d like to know. She talks awful, but
<span id="L446" class="ln">   446</span>	talk don&#39;t hurt--anyways it don&#39;t if she don&#39;t cry. Jim, I&#39;ll give you
<span id="L447" class="ln">   447</span>	a marvel. I&#39;ll give you a white alley!&#34;
<span id="L448" class="ln">   448</span>	
<span id="L449" class="ln">   449</span>	Jim began to waver.
<span id="L450" class="ln">   450</span>	
<span id="L451" class="ln">   451</span>	&#34;White alley, Jim! And it&#39;s a bully taw.&#34;
<span id="L452" class="ln">   452</span>	
<span id="L453" class="ln">   453</span>	&#34;My! Dat&#39;s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I&#39;s powerful
<span id="L454" class="ln">   454</span>	&#39;fraid ole missis--&#34;
<span id="L455" class="ln">   455</span>	
<span id="L456" class="ln">   456</span>	&#34;And besides, if you will I&#39;ll show you my sore toe.&#34;
<span id="L457" class="ln">   457</span>	
<span id="L458" class="ln">   458</span>	Jim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. He put down
<span id="L459" class="ln">   459</span>	his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
<span id="L460" class="ln">   460</span>	interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was
<span id="L461" class="ln">   461</span>	flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
<span id="L462" class="ln">   462</span>	whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field
<span id="L463" class="ln">   463</span>	with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.
<span id="L464" class="ln">   464</span>	
<span id="L465" class="ln">   465</span>	But Tom&#39;s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
<span id="L466" class="ln">   466</span>	planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
<span id="L467" class="ln">   467</span>	would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
<span id="L468" class="ln">   468</span>	they would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very
<span id="L469" class="ln">   469</span>	thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
<span id="L470" class="ln">   470</span>	examined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an
<span id="L471" class="ln">   471</span>	exchange of WORK, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an
<span id="L472" class="ln">   472</span>	hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his
<span id="L473" class="ln">   473</span>	pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark
<span id="L474" class="ln">   474</span>	and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a
<span id="L475" class="ln">   475</span>	great, magnificent inspiration.
<span id="L476" class="ln">   476</span>	
<span id="L477" class="ln">   477</span>	He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
<span id="L478" class="ln">   478</span>	sight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
<span id="L479" class="ln">   479</span>	dreading. Ben&#39;s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his
<span id="L480" class="ln">   480</span>	heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
<span id="L481" class="ln">   481</span>	giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
<span id="L482" class="ln">   482</span>	ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
<span id="L483" class="ln">   483</span>	he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
<span id="L484" class="ln">   484</span>	far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious
<span id="L485" class="ln">   485</span>	pomp and circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and
<span id="L486" class="ln">   486</span>	considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and
<span id="L487" class="ln">   487</span>	captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself
<span id="L488" class="ln">   488</span>	standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:
<span id="L489" class="ln">   489</span>	
<span id="L490" class="ln">   490</span>	&#34;Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!&#34; The headway ran almost out, and he
<span id="L491" class="ln">   491</span>	drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.
<span id="L492" class="ln">   492</span>	
<span id="L493" class="ln">   493</span>	&#34;Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!&#34; His arms straightened and
<span id="L494" class="ln">   494</span>	stiffened down his sides.
<span id="L495" class="ln">   495</span>	
<span id="L496" class="ln">   496</span>	&#34;Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
<span id="L497" class="ln">   497</span>	Chow!&#34; His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles--for it was
<span id="L498" class="ln">   498</span>	representing a forty-foot wheel.
<span id="L499" class="ln">   499</span>	
<span id="L500" class="ln">   500</span>	&#34;Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-lingling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!&#34;
<span id="L501" class="ln">   501</span>	The left hand began to describe circles.
<span id="L502" class="ln">   502</span>	
<span id="L503" class="ln">   503</span>	&#34;Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead
<span id="L504" class="ln">   504</span>	on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!
<span id="L505" class="ln">   505</span>	Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! LIVELY now!
<span id="L506" class="ln">   506</span>	Come--out with your spring-line--what&#39;re you about there! Take a turn
<span id="L507" class="ln">   507</span>	round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now--let her
<span id="L508" class="ln">   508</span>	go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH&#39;T! S&#39;H&#39;T! SH&#39;T!&#34;
<span id="L509" class="ln">   509</span>	(trying the gauge-cocks).
<span id="L510" class="ln">   510</span>	
<span id="L511" class="ln">   511</span>	Tom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben
<span id="L512" class="ln">   512</span>	stared a moment and then said: &#34;Hi-YI! YOU&#39;RE up a stump, ain&#39;t you!&#34;
<span id="L513" class="ln">   513</span>	
<span id="L514" class="ln">   514</span>	No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
<span id="L515" class="ln">   515</span>	he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
<span id="L516" class="ln">   516</span>	before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom&#39;s mouth watered for the
<span id="L517" class="ln">   517</span>	apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:
<span id="L518" class="ln">   518</span>	
<span id="L519" class="ln">   519</span>	&#34;Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?&#34;
<span id="L520" class="ln">   520</span>	
<span id="L521" class="ln">   521</span>	Tom wheeled suddenly and said:
<span id="L522" class="ln">   522</span>	
<span id="L523" class="ln">   523</span>	&#34;Why, it&#39;s you, Ben! I warn&#39;t noticing.&#34;
<span id="L524" class="ln">   524</span>	
<span id="L525" class="ln">   525</span>	&#34;Say--I&#39;m going in a-swimming, I am. Don&#39;t you wish you could? But of
<span id="L526" class="ln">   526</span>	course you&#39;d druther WORK--wouldn&#39;t you? Course you would!&#34;
<span id="L527" class="ln">   527</span>	
<span id="L528" class="ln">   528</span>	Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:
<span id="L529" class="ln">   529</span>	
<span id="L530" class="ln">   530</span>	&#34;What do you call work?&#34;
<span id="L531" class="ln">   531</span>	
<span id="L532" class="ln">   532</span>	&#34;Why, ain&#39;t THAT work?&#34;
<span id="L533" class="ln">   533</span>	
<span id="L534" class="ln">   534</span>	Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:
<span id="L535" class="ln">   535</span>	
<span id="L536" class="ln">   536</span>	&#34;Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain&#39;t. All I know, is, it suits Tom
<span id="L537" class="ln">   537</span>	Sawyer.&#34;
<span id="L538" class="ln">   538</span>	
<span id="L539" class="ln">   539</span>	&#34;Oh come, now, you don&#39;t mean to let on that you LIKE it?&#34;
<span id="L540" class="ln">   540</span>	
<span id="L541" class="ln">   541</span>	The brush continued to move.
<span id="L542" class="ln">   542</span>	
<span id="L543" class="ln">   543</span>	&#34;Like it? Well, I don&#39;t see why I oughtn&#39;t to like it. Does a boy get
<span id="L544" class="ln">   544</span>	a chance to whitewash a fence every day?&#34;
<span id="L545" class="ln">   545</span>	
<span id="L546" class="ln">   546</span>	That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom
<span id="L547" class="ln">   547</span>	swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the
<span id="L548" class="ln">   548</span>	effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben
<span id="L549" class="ln">   549</span>	watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
<span id="L550" class="ln">   550</span>	absorbed. Presently he said:
<span id="L551" class="ln">   551</span>	
<span id="L552" class="ln">   552</span>	&#34;Say, Tom, let ME whitewash a little.&#34;
<span id="L553" class="ln">   553</span>	
<span id="L554" class="ln">   554</span>	Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:
<span id="L555" class="ln">   555</span>	
<span id="L556" class="ln">   556</span>	&#34;No--no--I reckon it wouldn&#39;t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly&#39;s
<span id="L557" class="ln">   557</span>	awful particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know
<span id="L558" class="ln">   558</span>	--but if it was the back fence I wouldn&#39;t mind and SHE wouldn&#39;t. Yes,
<span id="L559" class="ln">   559</span>	she&#39;s awful particular about this fence; it&#39;s got to be done very
<span id="L560" class="ln">   560</span>	careful; I reckon there ain&#39;t one boy in a thousand, maybe two
<span id="L561" class="ln">   561</span>	thousand, that can do it the way it&#39;s got to be done.&#34;
<span id="L562" class="ln">   562</span>	
<span id="L563" class="ln">   563</span>	&#34;No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I&#39;d
<span id="L564" class="ln">   564</span>	let YOU, if you was me, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L565" class="ln">   565</span>	
<span id="L566" class="ln">   566</span>	&#34;Ben, I&#39;d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to
<span id="L567" class="ln">   567</span>	do it, but she wouldn&#39;t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn&#39;t
<span id="L568" class="ln">   568</span>	let Sid. Now don&#39;t you see how I&#39;m fixed? If you was to tackle this
<span id="L569" class="ln">   569</span>	fence and anything was to happen to it--&#34;
<span id="L570" class="ln">   570</span>	
<span id="L571" class="ln">   571</span>	&#34;Oh, shucks, I&#39;ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I&#39;ll give
<span id="L572" class="ln">   572</span>	you the core of my apple.&#34;
<span id="L573" class="ln">   573</span>	
<span id="L574" class="ln">   574</span>	&#34;Well, here--No, Ben, now don&#39;t. I&#39;m afeard--&#34;
<span id="L575" class="ln">   575</span>	
<span id="L576" class="ln">   576</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll give you ALL of it!&#34;
<span id="L577" class="ln">   577</span>	
<span id="L578" class="ln">   578</span>	Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
<span id="L579" class="ln">   579</span>	heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in
<span id="L580" class="ln">   580</span>	the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,
<span id="L581" class="ln">   581</span>	dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
<span id="L582" class="ln">   582</span>	innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
<span id="L583" class="ln">   583</span>	little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
<span id="L584" class="ln">   584</span>	Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
<span id="L585" class="ln">   585</span>	a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in
<span id="L586" class="ln">   586</span>	for a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on,
<span id="L587" class="ln">   587</span>	hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being
<span id="L588" class="ln">   588</span>	a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling
<span id="L589" class="ln">   589</span>	in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles,
<span id="L590" class="ln">   590</span>	part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a
<span id="L591" class="ln">   591</span>	spool cannon, a key that wouldn&#39;t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk,
<span id="L592" class="ln">   592</span>	a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six
<span id="L593" class="ln">   593</span>	fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a
<span id="L594" class="ln">   594</span>	dog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of
<span id="L595" class="ln">   595</span>	orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.
<span id="L596" class="ln">   596</span>	
<span id="L597" class="ln">   597</span>	He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of company
<span id="L598" class="ln">   598</span>	--and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn&#39;t run out
<span id="L599" class="ln">   599</span>	of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.
<span id="L600" class="ln">   600</span>	
<span id="L601" class="ln">   601</span>	Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
<span id="L602" class="ln">   602</span>	had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely,
<span id="L603" class="ln">   603</span>	that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only
<span id="L604" class="ln">   604</span>	necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great
<span id="L605" class="ln">   605</span>	and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
<span id="L606" class="ln">   606</span>	comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do,
<span id="L607" class="ln">   607</span>	and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And
<span id="L608" class="ln">   608</span>	this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers
<span id="L609" class="ln">   609</span>	or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or
<span id="L610" class="ln">   610</span>	climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in
<span id="L611" class="ln">   611</span>	England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles
<span id="L612" class="ln">   612</span>	on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them
<span id="L613" class="ln">   613</span>	considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service,
<span id="L614" class="ln">   614</span>	that would turn it into work and then they would resign.
<span id="L615" class="ln">   615</span>	
<span id="L616" class="ln">   616</span>	The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
<span id="L617" class="ln">   617</span>	in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
<span id="L618" class="ln">   618</span>	report.
<span id="L619" class="ln">   619</span>	
<span id="L620" class="ln">   620</span>	
<span id="L621" class="ln">   621</span>	
<span id="L622" class="ln">   622</span>	CHAPTER III
<span id="L623" class="ln">   623</span>	
<span id="L624" class="ln">   624</span>	TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open
<span id="L625" class="ln">   625</span>	window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
<span id="L626" class="ln">   626</span>	breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer
<span id="L627" class="ln">   627</span>	air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur
<span id="L628" class="ln">   628</span>	of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting
<span id="L629" class="ln">   629</span>	--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her
<span id="L630" class="ln">   630</span>	spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thought
<span id="L631" class="ln">   631</span>	that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him
<span id="L632" class="ln">   632</span>	place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: &#34;Mayn&#39;t
<span id="L633" class="ln">   633</span>	I go and play now, aunt?&#34;
<span id="L634" class="ln">   634</span>	
<span id="L635" class="ln">   635</span>	&#34;What, a&#39;ready? How much have you done?&#34;
<span id="L636" class="ln">   636</span>	
<span id="L637" class="ln">   637</span>	&#34;It&#39;s all done, aunt.&#34;
<span id="L638" class="ln">   638</span>	
<span id="L639" class="ln">   639</span>	&#34;Tom, don&#39;t lie to me--I can&#39;t bear it.&#34;
<span id="L640" class="ln">   640</span>	
<span id="L641" class="ln">   641</span>	&#34;I ain&#39;t, aunt; it IS all done.&#34;
<span id="L642" class="ln">   642</span>	
<span id="L643" class="ln">   643</span>	Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see
<span id="L644" class="ln">   644</span>	for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent.
<span id="L645" class="ln">   645</span>	of Tom&#39;s statement true. When she found the entire fence whitewashed,
<span id="L646" class="ln">   646</span>	and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even
<span id="L647" class="ln">   647</span>	a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable.
<span id="L648" class="ln">   648</span>	She said:
<span id="L649" class="ln">   649</span>	
<span id="L650" class="ln">   650</span>	&#34;Well, I never! There&#39;s no getting round it, you can work when you&#39;re
<span id="L651" class="ln">   651</span>	a mind to, Tom.&#34; And then she diluted the compliment by adding, &#34;But
<span id="L652" class="ln">   652</span>	it&#39;s powerful seldom you&#39;re a mind to, I&#39;m bound to say. Well, go &#39;long
<span id="L653" class="ln">   653</span>	and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I&#39;ll tan you.&#34;
<span id="L654" class="ln">   654</span>	
<span id="L655" class="ln">   655</span>	She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
<span id="L656" class="ln">   656</span>	him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to
<span id="L657" class="ln">   657</span>	him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a
<span id="L658" class="ln">   658</span>	treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.
<span id="L659" class="ln">   659</span>	And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he &#34;hooked&#34; a
<span id="L660" class="ln">   660</span>	doughnut.
<span id="L661" class="ln">   661</span>	
<span id="L662" class="ln">   662</span>	Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
<span id="L663" class="ln">   663</span>	that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and
<span id="L664" class="ln">   664</span>	the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a
<span id="L665" class="ln">   665</span>	hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties
<span id="L666" class="ln">   666</span>	and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
<span id="L667" class="ln">   667</span>	and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general
<span id="L668" class="ln">   668</span>	thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at
<span id="L669" class="ln">   669</span>	peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his
<span id="L670" class="ln">   670</span>	black thread and getting him into trouble.
<span id="L671" class="ln">   671</span>	
<span id="L672" class="ln">   672</span>	Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by
<span id="L673" class="ln">   673</span>	the back of his aunt&#39;s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the
<span id="L674" class="ln">   674</span>	reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square
<span id="L675" class="ln">   675</span>	of the village, where two &#34;military&#34; companies of boys had met for
<span id="L676" class="ln">   676</span>	conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of
<span id="L677" class="ln">   677</span>	these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These
<span id="L678" class="ln">   678</span>	two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being
<span id="L679" class="ln">   679</span>	better suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence
<span id="L680" class="ln">   680</span>	and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
<span id="L681" class="ln">   681</span>	aides-de-camp. Tom&#39;s army won a great victory, after a long and
<span id="L682" class="ln">   682</span>	hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,
<span id="L683" class="ln">   683</span>	the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
<span id="L684" class="ln">   684</span>	necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and
<span id="L685" class="ln">   685</span>	marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.
<span id="L686" class="ln">   686</span>	
<span id="L687" class="ln">   687</span>	As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
<span id="L688" class="ln">   688</span>	girl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair
<span id="L689" class="ln">   689</span>	plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
<span id="L690" class="ln">   690</span>	pantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A
<span id="L691" class="ln">   691</span>	certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
<span id="L692" class="ln">   692</span>	memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;
<span id="L693" class="ln">   693</span>	he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
<span id="L694" class="ln">   694</span>	little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had
<span id="L695" class="ln">   695</span>	confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
<span id="L696" class="ln">   696</span>	boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
<span id="L697" class="ln">   697</span>	she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
<span id="L698" class="ln">   698</span>	done.
<span id="L699" class="ln">   699</span>	
<span id="L700" class="ln">   700</span>	He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she
<span id="L701" class="ln">   701</span>	had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present,
<span id="L702" class="ln">   702</span>	and began to &#34;show off&#34; in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to
<span id="L703" class="ln">   703</span>	win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some
<span id="L704" class="ln">   704</span>	time; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous
<span id="L705" class="ln">   705</span>	gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl
<span id="L706" class="ln">   706</span>	was wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and
<span id="L707" class="ln">   707</span>	leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.
<span id="L708" class="ln">   708</span>	She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom
<span id="L709" class="ln">   709</span>	heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face
<span id="L710" class="ln">   710</span>	lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment
<span id="L711" class="ln">   711</span>	before she disappeared.
<span id="L712" class="ln">   712</span>	
<span id="L713" class="ln">   713</span>	The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
<span id="L714" class="ln">   714</span>	then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if
<span id="L715" class="ln">   715</span>	he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
<span id="L716" class="ln">   716</span>	Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
<span id="L717" class="ln">   717</span>	nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,
<span id="L718" class="ln">   718</span>	in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally
<span id="L719" class="ln">   719</span>	his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he
<span id="L720" class="ln">   720</span>	hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But
<span id="L721" class="ln">   721</span>	only for a minute--only while he could button the flower inside his
<span id="L722" class="ln">   722</span>	jacket, next his heart--or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not
<span id="L723" class="ln">   723</span>	much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.
<span id="L724" class="ln">   724</span>	
<span id="L725" class="ln">   725</span>	He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, &#34;showing
<span id="L726" class="ln">   726</span>	off,&#34; as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom
<span id="L727" class="ln">   727</span>	comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
<span id="L728" class="ln">   728</span>	window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode
<span id="L729" class="ln">   729</span>	home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.
<span id="L730" class="ln">   730</span>	
<span id="L731" class="ln">   731</span>	All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered
<span id="L732" class="ln">   732</span>	&#34;what had got into the child.&#34; He took a good scolding about clodding
<span id="L733" class="ln">   733</span>	Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar
<span id="L734" class="ln">   734</span>	under his aunt&#39;s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:
<span id="L735" class="ln">   735</span>	
<span id="L736" class="ln">   736</span>	&#34;Aunt, you don&#39;t whack Sid when he takes it.&#34;
<span id="L737" class="ln">   737</span>	
<span id="L738" class="ln">   738</span>	&#34;Well, Sid don&#39;t torment a body the way you do. You&#39;d be always into
<span id="L739" class="ln">   739</span>	that sugar if I warn&#39;t watching you.&#34;
<span id="L740" class="ln">   740</span>	
<span id="L741" class="ln">   741</span>	Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his
<span id="L742" class="ln">   742</span>	immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl--a sort of glorying over Tom which
<span id="L743" class="ln">   743</span>	was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid&#39;s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped
<span id="L744" class="ln">   744</span>	and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even
<span id="L745" class="ln">   745</span>	controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would
<span id="L746" class="ln">   746</span>	not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly
<span id="L747" class="ln">   747</span>	still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and
<span id="L748" class="ln">   748</span>	there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model
<span id="L749" class="ln">   749</span>	&#34;catch it.&#34; He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold
<span id="L750" class="ln">   750</span>	himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck
<span id="L751" class="ln">   751</span>	discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said to
<span id="L752" class="ln">   752</span>	himself, &#34;Now it&#39;s coming!&#34; And the next instant he was sprawling on
<span id="L753" class="ln">   753</span>	the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried
<span id="L754" class="ln">   754</span>	out:
<span id="L755" class="ln">   755</span>	
<span id="L756" class="ln">   756</span>	&#34;Hold on, now, what &#39;er you belting ME for?--Sid broke it!&#34;
<span id="L757" class="ln">   757</span>	
<span id="L758" class="ln">   758</span>	Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But
<span id="L759" class="ln">   759</span>	when she got her tongue again, she only said:
<span id="L760" class="ln">   760</span>	
<span id="L761" class="ln">   761</span>	&#34;Umf! Well, you didn&#39;t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some
<span id="L762" class="ln">   762</span>	other audacious mischief when I wasn&#39;t around, like enough.&#34;
<span id="L763" class="ln">   763</span>	
<span id="L764" class="ln">   764</span>	Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
<span id="L765" class="ln">   765</span>	kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
<span id="L766" class="ln">   766</span>	confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
<span id="L767" class="ln">   767</span>	So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
<span id="L768" class="ln">   768</span>	Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart
<span id="L769" class="ln">   769</span>	his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the
<span id="L770" class="ln">   770</span>	consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice
<span id="L771" class="ln">   771</span>	of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,
<span id="L772" class="ln">   772</span>	through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured
<span id="L773" class="ln">   773</span>	himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
<span id="L774" class="ln">   774</span>	one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and
<span id="L775" class="ln">   775</span>	die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured
<span id="L776" class="ln">   776</span>	himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and
<span id="L777" class="ln">   777</span>	his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how
<span id="L778" class="ln">   778</span>	her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back
<span id="L779" class="ln">   779</span>	her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie
<span id="L780" class="ln">   780</span>	there cold and white and make no sign--a poor little sufferer, whose
<span id="L781" class="ln">   781</span>	griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos
<span id="L782" class="ln">   782</span>	of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to
<span id="L783" class="ln">   783</span>	choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he
<span id="L784" class="ln">   784</span>	winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a
<span id="L785" class="ln">   785</span>	luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear
<span id="L786" class="ln">   786</span>	to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it;
<span id="L787" class="ln">   787</span>	it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin
<span id="L788" class="ln">   788</span>	Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an
<span id="L789" class="ln">   789</span>	age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in
<span id="L790" class="ln">   790</span>	clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in
<span id="L791" class="ln">   791</span>	at the other.
<span id="L792" class="ln">   792</span>	
<span id="L793" class="ln">   793</span>	He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought
<span id="L794" class="ln">   794</span>	desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the
<span id="L795" class="ln">   795</span>	river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and
<span id="L796" class="ln">   796</span>	contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while,
<span id="L797" class="ln">   797</span>	that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without
<span id="L798" class="ln">   798</span>	undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought
<span id="L799" class="ln">   799</span>	of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily
<span id="L800" class="ln">   800</span>	increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she
<span id="L801" class="ln">   801</span>	knew? Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms
<span id="L802" class="ln">   802</span>	around his neck and comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all
<span id="L803" class="ln">   803</span>	the hollow world? This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable
<span id="L804" class="ln">   804</span>	suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it
<span id="L805" class="ln">   805</span>	up in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he
<span id="L806" class="ln">   806</span>	rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.
<span id="L807" class="ln">   807</span>	
<span id="L808" class="ln">   808</span>	About half-past nine or ten o&#39;clock he came along the deserted street
<span id="L809" class="ln">   809</span>	to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell
<span id="L810" class="ln">   810</span>	upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the
<span id="L811" class="ln">   811</span>	curtain of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He
<span id="L812" class="ln">   812</span>	climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till
<span id="L813" class="ln">   813</span>	he stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion;
<span id="L814" class="ln">   814</span>	then he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon
<span id="L815" class="ln">   815</span>	his back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor
<span id="L816" class="ln">   816</span>	wilted flower. And thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no
<span id="L817" class="ln">   817</span>	shelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the
<span id="L818" class="ln">   818</span>	death-damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him
<span id="L819" class="ln">   819</span>	when the great agony came. And thus SHE would see him when she looked
<span id="L820" class="ln">   820</span>	out upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear upon
<span id="L821" class="ln">   821</span>	his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright
<span id="L822" class="ln">   822</span>	young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?
<span id="L823" class="ln">   823</span>	
<span id="L824" class="ln">   824</span>	The window went up, a maid-servant&#39;s discordant voice profaned the
<span id="L825" class="ln">   825</span>	holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr&#39;s remains!
<span id="L826" class="ln">   826</span>	
<span id="L827" class="ln">   827</span>	The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz
<span id="L828" class="ln">   828</span>	as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound
<span id="L829" class="ln">   829</span>	as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the
<span id="L830" class="ln">   830</span>	fence and shot away in the gloom.
<span id="L831" class="ln">   831</span>	
<span id="L832" class="ln">   832</span>	Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
<span id="L833" class="ln">   833</span>	drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he
<span id="L834" class="ln">   834</span>	had any dim idea of making any &#34;references to allusions,&#34; he thought
<span id="L835" class="ln">   835</span>	better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom&#39;s eye.
<span id="L836" class="ln">   836</span>	
<span id="L837" class="ln">   837</span>	Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made
<span id="L838" class="ln">   838</span>	mental note of the omission.
<span id="L839" class="ln">   839</span>	
<span id="L840" class="ln">   840</span>

<span id="L843" class="ln">   843</span>	
<span id="L844" class="ln">   844</span>	THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
<span id="L845" class="ln">   845</span>	village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
<span id="L846" class="ln">   846</span>	worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
<span id="L847" class="ln">   847</span>	courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
<span id="L848" class="ln">   848</span>	originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter
<span id="L849" class="ln">   849</span>	of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.
<span id="L850" class="ln">   850</span>	
<span id="L851" class="ln">   851</span>	Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to &#34;get
<span id="L852" class="ln">   852</span>	his verses.&#34; Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his
<span id="L853" class="ln">   853</span>	energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
<span id="L854" class="ln">   854</span>	Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
<span id="L855" class="ln">   855</span>	At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
<span id="L856" class="ln">   856</span>	but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
<span id="L857" class="ln">   857</span>	thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary
<span id="L858" class="ln">   858</span>	took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through
<span id="L859" class="ln">   859</span>	the fog:
<span id="L860" class="ln">   860</span>	
<span id="L861" class="ln">   861</span>	&#34;Blessed are the--a--a--&#34;
<span id="L862" class="ln">   862</span>	
<span id="L863" class="ln">   863</span>	&#34;Poor&#34;--
<span id="L864" class="ln">   864</span>	
<span id="L865" class="ln">   865</span>	&#34;Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--&#34;
<span id="L866" class="ln">   866</span>	
<span id="L867" class="ln">   867</span>	&#34;In spirit--&#34;
<span id="L868" class="ln">   868</span>	
<span id="L869" class="ln">   869</span>	&#34;In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--&#34;
<span id="L870" class="ln">   870</span>	
<span id="L871" class="ln">   871</span>	&#34;THEIRS--&#34;
<span id="L872" class="ln">   872</span>	
<span id="L873" class="ln">   873</span>	&#34;For THEIRS. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
<span id="L874" class="ln">   874</span>	of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--&#34;
<span id="L875" class="ln">   875</span>	
<span id="L876" class="ln">   876</span>	&#34;Sh--&#34;
<span id="L877" class="ln">   877</span>	
<span id="L878" class="ln">   878</span>	&#34;For they--a--&#34;
<span id="L879" class="ln">   879</span>	
<span id="L880" class="ln">   880</span>	&#34;S, H, A--&#34;
<span id="L881" class="ln">   881</span>	
<span id="L882" class="ln">   882</span>	&#34;For they S, H--Oh, I don&#39;t know what it is!&#34;
<span id="L883" class="ln">   883</span>	
<span id="L884" class="ln">   884</span>	&#34;SHALL!&#34;
<span id="L885" class="ln">   885</span>	
<span id="L886" class="ln">   886</span>	&#34;Oh, SHALL! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--
<span id="L887" class="ln">   887</span>	blessed are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for
<span id="L888" class="ln">   888</span>	they shall--a--shall WHAT? Why don&#39;t you tell me, Mary?--what do you
<span id="L889" class="ln">   889</span>	want to be so mean for?&#34;
<span id="L890" class="ln">   890</span>	
<span id="L891" class="ln">   891</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I&#39;m not teasing you. I wouldn&#39;t
<span id="L892" class="ln">   892</span>	do that. You must go and learn it again. Don&#39;t you be discouraged, Tom,
<span id="L893" class="ln">   893</span>	you&#39;ll manage it--and if you do, I&#39;ll give you something ever so nice.
<span id="L894" class="ln">   894</span>	There, now, that&#39;s a good boy.&#34;
<span id="L895" class="ln">   895</span>	
<span id="L896" class="ln">   896</span>	&#34;All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.&#34;
<span id="L897" class="ln">   897</span>	
<span id="L898" class="ln">   898</span>	&#34;Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it&#39;s nice, it is nice.&#34;
<span id="L899" class="ln">   899</span>	
<span id="L900" class="ln">   900</span>	&#34;You bet you that&#39;s so, Mary. All right, I&#39;ll tackle it again.&#34;
<span id="L901" class="ln">   901</span>	
<span id="L902" class="ln">   902</span>	And he did &#34;tackle it again&#34;--and under the double pressure of
<span id="L903" class="ln">   903</span>	curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he
<span id="L904" class="ln">   904</span>	accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new &#34;Barlow&#34;
<span id="L905" class="ln">   905</span>	knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that
<span id="L906" class="ln">   906</span>	swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would
<span id="L907" class="ln">   907</span>	not cut anything, but it was a &#34;sure-enough&#34; Barlow, and there was
<span id="L908" class="ln">   908</span>	inconceivable grandeur in that--though where the Western boys ever got
<span id="L909" class="ln">   909</span>	the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its
<span id="L910" class="ln">   910</span>	injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom
<span id="L911" class="ln">   911</span>	contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin
<span id="L912" class="ln">   912</span>	on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.
<span id="L913" class="ln">   913</span>	
<span id="L914" class="ln">   914</span>	Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
<span id="L915" class="ln">   915</span>	outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
<span id="L916" class="ln">   916</span>	dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
<span id="L917" class="ln">   917</span>	poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the
<span id="L918" class="ln">   918</span>	kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the
<span id="L919" class="ln">   919</span>	door. But Mary removed the towel and said:
<span id="L920" class="ln">   920</span>	
<span id="L921" class="ln">   921</span>	&#34;Now ain&#39;t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn&#39;t be so bad. Water won&#39;t hurt
<span id="L922" class="ln">   922</span>	you.&#34;
<span id="L923" class="ln">   923</span>	
<span id="L924" class="ln">   924</span>	Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time
<span id="L925" class="ln">   925</span>	he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big
<span id="L926" class="ln">   926</span>	breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes
<span id="L927" class="ln">   927</span>	shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony
<span id="L928" class="ln">   928</span>	of suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from
<span id="L929" class="ln">   929</span>	the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
<span id="L930" class="ln">   930</span>	short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
<span id="L931" class="ln">   931</span>	there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
<span id="L932" class="ln">   932</span>	front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
<span id="L933" class="ln">   933</span>	was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
<span id="L934" class="ln">   934</span>	color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
<span id="L935" class="ln">   935</span>	wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately
<span id="L936" class="ln">   936</span>	smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
<span id="L937" class="ln">   937</span>	hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and
<span id="L938" class="ln">   938</span>	his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of
<span id="L939" class="ln">   939</span>	his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they
<span id="L940" class="ln">   940</span>	were simply called his &#34;other clothes&#34;--and so by that we know the
<span id="L941" class="ln">   941</span>	size of his wardrobe. The girl &#34;put him to rights&#34; after he had dressed
<span id="L942" class="ln">   942</span>	himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his
<span id="L943" class="ln">   943</span>	vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned
<span id="L944" class="ln">   944</span>	him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and
<span id="L945" class="ln">   945</span>	uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there
<span id="L946" class="ln">   946</span>	was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He
<span id="L947" class="ln">   947</span>	hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
<span id="L948" class="ln">   948</span>	coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them
<span id="L949" class="ln">   949</span>	out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
<span id="L950" class="ln">   950</span>	everything he didn&#39;t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:
<span id="L951" class="ln">   951</span>	
<span id="L952" class="ln">   952</span>	&#34;Please, Tom--that&#39;s a good boy.&#34;
<span id="L953" class="ln">   953</span>	
<span id="L954" class="ln">   954</span>	So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
<span id="L955" class="ln">   955</span>	children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his
<span id="L956" class="ln">   956</span>	whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.
<span id="L957" class="ln">   957</span>	
<span id="L958" class="ln">   958</span>	Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
<span id="L959" class="ln">   959</span>	service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon
<span id="L960" class="ln">   960</span>	voluntarily, and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons.
<span id="L961" class="ln">   961</span>	The church&#39;s high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three
<span id="L962" class="ln">   962</span>	hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort
<span id="L963" class="ln">   963</span>	of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom
<span id="L964" class="ln">   964</span>	dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:
<span id="L965" class="ln">   965</span>	
<span id="L966" class="ln">   966</span>	&#34;Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?&#34;
<span id="L967" class="ln">   967</span>	
<span id="L968" class="ln">   968</span>	&#34;Yes.&#34;
<span id="L969" class="ln">   969</span>	
<span id="L970" class="ln">   970</span>	&#34;What&#39;ll you take for her?&#34;
<span id="L971" class="ln">   971</span>	
<span id="L972" class="ln">   972</span>	&#34;What&#39;ll you give?&#34;
<span id="L973" class="ln">   973</span>	
<span id="L974" class="ln">   974</span>	&#34;Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.&#34;
<span id="L975" class="ln">   975</span>	
<span id="L976" class="ln">   976</span>	&#34;Less see &#39;em.&#34;
<span id="L977" class="ln">   977</span>	
<span id="L978" class="ln">   978</span>	Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.
<span id="L979" class="ln">   979</span>	Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and
<span id="L980" class="ln">   980</span>	some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other
<span id="L981" class="ln">   981</span>	boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or
<span id="L982" class="ln">   982</span>	fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of
<span id="L983" class="ln">   983</span>	clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a
<span id="L984" class="ln">   984</span>	quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,
<span id="L985" class="ln">   985</span>	elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
<span id="L986" class="ln">   986</span>	boy&#39;s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
<span id="L987" class="ln">   987</span>	turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
<span id="L988" class="ln">   988</span>	him say &#34;Ouch!&#34; and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom&#39;s whole
<span id="L989" class="ln">   989</span>	class were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they
<span id="L990" class="ln">   990</span>	came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses
<span id="L991" class="ln">   991</span>	perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried
<span id="L992" class="ln">   992</span>	through, and each got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a
<span id="L993" class="ln">   993</span>	passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of
<span id="L994" class="ln">   994</span>	the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be
<span id="L995" class="ln">   995</span>	exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow
<span id="L996" class="ln">   996</span>	tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty
<span id="L997" class="ln">   997</span>	cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would
<span id="L998" class="ln">   998</span>	have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even
<span id="L999" class="ln">   999</span>	for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it
<span id="L1000" class="ln">  1000</span>	was the patient work of two years--and a boy of German parentage had
<span id="L1001" class="ln">  1001</span>	won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without
<span id="L1002" class="ln">  1002</span>	stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and
<span id="L1003" class="ln">  1003</span>	he was little better than an idiot from that day forth--a grievous
<span id="L1004" class="ln">  1004</span>	misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the
<span id="L1005" class="ln">  1005</span>	superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out
<span id="L1006" class="ln">  1006</span>	and &#34;spread himself.&#34; Only the older pupils managed to keep their
<span id="L1007" class="ln">  1007</span>	tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and
<span id="L1008" class="ln">  1008</span>	so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy
<span id="L1009" class="ln">  1009</span>	circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for
<span id="L1010" class="ln">  1010</span>	that day that on the spot every scholar&#39;s heart was fired with a fresh
<span id="L1011" class="ln">  1011</span>	ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom&#39;s
<span id="L1012" class="ln">  1012</span>	mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but
<span id="L1013" class="ln">  1013</span>	unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory
<span id="L1014" class="ln">  1014</span>	and the eclat that came with it.
<span id="L1015" class="ln">  1015</span>	
<span id="L1016" class="ln">  1016</span>	In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with
<span id="L1017" class="ln">  1017</span>	a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
<span id="L1018" class="ln">  1018</span>	leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent
<span id="L1019" class="ln">  1019</span>	makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
<span id="L1020" class="ln">  1020</span>	necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
<span id="L1021" class="ln">  1021</span>	who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert
<span id="L1022" class="ln">  1022</span>	--though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of
<span id="L1023" class="ln">  1023</span>	music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a
<span id="L1024" class="ln">  1024</span>	slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair;
<span id="L1025" class="ln">  1025</span>	he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his
<span id="L1026" class="ln">  1026</span>	ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his
<span id="L1027" class="ln">  1027</span>	mouth--a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning
<span id="L1028" class="ln">  1028</span>	of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped
<span id="L1029" class="ln">  1029</span>	on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note,
<span id="L1030" class="ln">  1030</span>	and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the
<span id="L1031" class="ln">  1031</span>	fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and
<span id="L1032" class="ln">  1032</span>	laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes
<span id="L1033" class="ln">  1033</span>	pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest
<span id="L1034" class="ln">  1034</span>	of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred
<span id="L1035" class="ln">  1035</span>	things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly
<span id="L1036" class="ln">  1036</span>	matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had
<span id="L1037" class="ln">  1037</span>	acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He
<span id="L1038" class="ln">  1038</span>	began after this fashion:
<span id="L1039" class="ln">  1039</span>	
<span id="L1040" class="ln">  1040</span>	&#34;Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty
<span id="L1041" class="ln">  1041</span>	as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There
<span id="L1042" class="ln">  1042</span>	--that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see
<span id="L1043" class="ln">  1043</span>	one little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she
<span id="L1044" class="ln">  1044</span>	thinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making
<span id="L1045" class="ln">  1045</span>	a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you
<span id="L1046" class="ln">  1046</span>	how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces
<span id="L1047" class="ln">  1047</span>	assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.&#34; And
<span id="L1048" class="ln">  1048</span>	so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the
<span id="L1049" class="ln">  1049</span>	oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar
<span id="L1050" class="ln">  1050</span>	to us all.
<span id="L1051" class="ln">  1051</span>	
<span id="L1052" class="ln">  1052</span>	The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
<span id="L1053" class="ln">  1053</span>	and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
<span id="L1054" class="ln">  1054</span>	and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases
<span id="L1055" class="ln">  1055</span>	of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every
<span id="L1056" class="ln">  1056</span>	sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters&#39; voice, and
<span id="L1057" class="ln">  1057</span>	the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent
<span id="L1058" class="ln">  1058</span>	gratitude.
<span id="L1059" class="ln">  1059</span>	
<span id="L1060" class="ln">  1060</span>	A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which
<span id="L1061" class="ln">  1061</span>	was more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher,
<span id="L1062" class="ln">  1062</span>	accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged
<span id="L1063" class="ln">  1063</span>	gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless
<span id="L1064" class="ln">  1064</span>	the latter&#39;s wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless
<span id="L1065" class="ln">  1065</span>	and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could
<span id="L1066" class="ln">  1066</span>	not meet Amy Lawrence&#39;s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But
<span id="L1067" class="ln">  1067</span>	when he saw this small new-comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in
<span id="L1068" class="ln">  1068</span>	a moment. The next moment he was &#34;showing off&#34; with all his might
<span id="L1069" class="ln">  1069</span>	--cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces--in a word, using every art
<span id="L1070" class="ln">  1070</span>	that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His
<span id="L1071" class="ln">  1071</span>	exaltation had but one alloy--the memory of his humiliation in this
<span id="L1072" class="ln">  1072</span>	angel&#39;s garden--and that record in sand was fast washing out, under
<span id="L1073" class="ln">  1073</span>	the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.
<span id="L1074" class="ln">  1074</span>	
<span id="L1075" class="ln">  1075</span>	The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
<span id="L1076" class="ln">  1076</span>	Walters&#39; speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
<span id="L1077" class="ln">  1077</span>	middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one
<span id="L1078" class="ln">  1078</span>	than the county judge--altogether the most august creation these
<span id="L1079" class="ln">  1079</span>	children had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material
<span id="L1080" class="ln">  1080</span>	he was made of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half
<span id="L1081" class="ln">  1081</span>	afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so
<span id="L1082" class="ln">  1082</span>	he had travelled, and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon
<span id="L1083" class="ln">  1083</span>	the county court-house--which was said to have a tin roof. The awe
<span id="L1084" class="ln">  1084</span>	which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence
<span id="L1085" class="ln">  1085</span>	and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher,
<span id="L1086" class="ln">  1086</span>	brother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to
<span id="L1087" class="ln">  1087</span>	be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would
<span id="L1088" class="ln">  1088</span>	have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:
<span id="L1089" class="ln">  1089</span>	
<span id="L1090" class="ln">  1090</span>	&#34;Look at him, Jim! He&#39;s a going up there. Say--look! he&#39;s a going to
<span id="L1091" class="ln">  1091</span>	shake hands with him--he IS shaking hands with him! By jings, don&#39;t you
<span id="L1092" class="ln">  1092</span>	wish you was Jeff?&#34;
<span id="L1093" class="ln">  1093</span>	
<span id="L1094" class="ln">  1094</span>	Mr. Walters fell to &#34;showing off,&#34; with all sorts of official
<span id="L1095" class="ln">  1095</span>	bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,
<span id="L1096" class="ln">  1096</span>	discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a
<span id="L1097" class="ln">  1097</span>	target. The librarian &#34;showed off&#34;--running hither and thither with his
<span id="L1098" class="ln">  1098</span>	arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that
<span id="L1099" class="ln">  1099</span>	insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers &#34;showed off&#34;
<span id="L1100" class="ln">  1100</span>	--bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting
<span id="L1101" class="ln">  1101</span>	pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones
<span id="L1102" class="ln">  1102</span>	lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers &#34;showed off&#34; with small
<span id="L1103" class="ln">  1103</span>	scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to
<span id="L1104" class="ln">  1104</span>	discipline--and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up
<span id="L1105" class="ln">  1105</span>	at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had
<span id="L1106" class="ln">  1106</span>	to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation).
<span id="L1107" class="ln">  1107</span>	The little girls &#34;showed off&#34; in various ways, and the little boys
<span id="L1108" class="ln">  1108</span>	&#34;showed off&#34; with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads
<span id="L1109" class="ln">  1109</span>	and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and
<span id="L1110" class="ln">  1110</span>	beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself
<span id="L1111" class="ln">  1111</span>	in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was &#34;showing off,&#34; too.
<span id="L1112" class="ln">  1112</span>	
<span id="L1113" class="ln">  1113</span>	There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters&#39; ecstasy
<span id="L1114" class="ln">  1114</span>	complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a
<span id="L1115" class="ln">  1115</span>	prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough
<span id="L1116" class="ln">  1116</span>	--he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given
<span id="L1117" class="ln">  1117</span>	worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.
<span id="L1118" class="ln">  1118</span>	
<span id="L1119" class="ln">  1119</span>	And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward
<span id="L1120" class="ln">  1120</span>	with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and
<span id="L1121" class="ln">  1121</span>	demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters
<span id="L1122" class="ln">  1122</span>	was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten
<span id="L1123" class="ln">  1123</span>	years. But there was no getting around it--here were the certified
<span id="L1124" class="ln">  1124</span>	checks, and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated
<span id="L1125" class="ln">  1125</span>	to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was
<span id="L1126" class="ln">  1126</span>	announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the
<span id="L1127" class="ln">  1127</span>	decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero
<span id="L1128" class="ln">  1128</span>	up to the judicial one&#39;s altitude, and the school had two marvels to
<span id="L1129" class="ln">  1129</span>	gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but
<span id="L1130" class="ln">  1130</span>	those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too
<span id="L1131" class="ln">  1131</span>	late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by
<span id="L1132" class="ln">  1132</span>	trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling
<span id="L1133" class="ln">  1133</span>	whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes
<span id="L1134" class="ln">  1134</span>	of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.
<span id="L1135" class="ln">  1135</span>	
<span id="L1136" class="ln">  1136</span>	The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
<span id="L1137" class="ln">  1137</span>	superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
<span id="L1138" class="ln">  1138</span>	somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow&#39;s instinct taught him
<span id="L1139" class="ln">  1139</span>	that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
<span id="L1140" class="ln">  1140</span>	perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
<span id="L1141" class="ln">  1141</span>	thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would
<span id="L1142" class="ln">  1142</span>	strain his capacity, without a doubt.
<span id="L1143" class="ln">  1143</span>	
<span id="L1144" class="ln">  1144</span>	Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in
<span id="L1145" class="ln">  1145</span>	her face--but he wouldn&#39;t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
<span id="L1146" class="ln">  1146</span>	troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;
<span id="L1147" class="ln">  1147</span>	a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was
<span id="L1148" class="ln">  1148</span>	jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom
<span id="L1149" class="ln">  1149</span>	most of all (she thought).
<span id="L1150" class="ln">  1150</span>	
<span id="L1151" class="ln">  1151</span>	Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
<span id="L1152" class="ln">  1152</span>	would hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful
<span id="L1153" class="ln">  1153</span>	greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would
<span id="L1154" class="ln">  1154</span>	have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The
<span id="L1155" class="ln">  1155</span>	Judge put his hand on Tom&#39;s head and called him a fine little man, and
<span id="L1156" class="ln">  1156</span>	asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
<span id="L1157" class="ln">  1157</span>	
<span id="L1158" class="ln">  1158</span>	&#34;Tom.&#34;
<span id="L1159" class="ln">  1159</span>	
<span id="L1160" class="ln">  1160</span>	&#34;Oh, no, not Tom--it is--&#34;
<span id="L1161" class="ln">  1161</span>	
<span id="L1162" class="ln">  1162</span>	&#34;Thomas.&#34;
<span id="L1163" class="ln">  1163</span>	
<span id="L1164" class="ln">  1164</span>	&#34;Ah, that&#39;s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That&#39;s very
<span id="L1165" class="ln">  1165</span>	well. But you&#39;ve another one I daresay, and you&#39;ll tell it to me, won&#39;t
<span id="L1166" class="ln">  1166</span>	you?&#34;
<span id="L1167" class="ln">  1167</span>	
<span id="L1168" class="ln">  1168</span>	&#34;Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,&#34; said Walters, &#34;and say
<span id="L1169" class="ln">  1169</span>	sir. You mustn&#39;t forget your manners.&#34;
<span id="L1170" class="ln">  1170</span>	
<span id="L1171" class="ln">  1171</span>	&#34;Thomas Sawyer--sir.&#34;
<span id="L1172" class="ln">  1172</span>	
<span id="L1173" class="ln">  1173</span>	&#34;That&#39;s it! That&#39;s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow.
<span id="L1174" class="ln">  1174</span>	Two thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. And you
<span id="L1175" class="ln">  1175</span>	never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for
<span id="L1176" class="ln">  1176</span>	knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it&#39;s what
<span id="L1177" class="ln">  1177</span>	makes great men and good men; you&#39;ll be a great man and a good man
<span id="L1178" class="ln">  1178</span>	yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you&#39;ll look back and say, It&#39;s all
<span id="L1179" class="ln">  1179</span>	owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it&#39;s all
<span id="L1180" class="ln">  1180</span>	owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn--it&#39;s all owing to
<span id="L1181" class="ln">  1181</span>	the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and
<span id="L1182" class="ln">  1182</span>	gave me a beautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have
<span id="L1183" class="ln">  1183</span>	it all for my own, always--it&#39;s all owing to right bringing up! That is
<span id="L1184" class="ln">  1184</span>	what you will say, Thomas--and you wouldn&#39;t take any money for those
<span id="L1185" class="ln">  1185</span>	two thousand verses--no indeed you wouldn&#39;t. And now you wouldn&#39;t mind
<span id="L1186" class="ln">  1186</span>	telling me and this lady some of the things you&#39;ve learned--no, I know
<span id="L1187" class="ln">  1187</span>	you wouldn&#39;t--for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no
<span id="L1188" class="ln">  1188</span>	doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won&#39;t you tell us
<span id="L1189" class="ln">  1189</span>	the names of the first two that were appointed?&#34;
<span id="L1190" class="ln">  1190</span>	
<span id="L1191" class="ln">  1191</span>	Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,
<span id="L1192" class="ln">  1192</span>	now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters&#39; heart sank within him. He said to
<span id="L1193" class="ln">  1193</span>	himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
<span id="L1194" class="ln">  1194</span>	question--why DID the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up
<span id="L1195" class="ln">  1195</span>	and say:
<span id="L1196" class="ln">  1196</span>	
<span id="L1197" class="ln">  1197</span>	&#34;Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don&#39;t be afraid.&#34;
<span id="L1198" class="ln">  1198</span>	
<span id="L1199" class="ln">  1199</span>	Tom still hung fire.
<span id="L1200" class="ln">  1200</span>	
<span id="L1201" class="ln">  1201</span>	&#34;Now I know you&#39;ll tell me,&#34; said the lady. &#34;The names of the first
<span id="L1202" class="ln">  1202</span>	two disciples were--&#34;
<span id="L1203" class="ln">  1203</span>	
<span id="L1204" class="ln">  1204</span>	&#34;DAVID AND GOLIAH!&#34;
<span id="L1205" class="ln">  1205</span>	
<span id="L1206" class="ln">  1206</span>	Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.
<span id="L1207" class="ln">  1207</span>	
<span id="L1208" class="ln">  1208</span>	
<span id="L1209" class="ln">  1209</span>	
<span id="L1210" class="ln">  1210</span>	CHAPTER V
<span id="L1211" class="ln">  1211</span>	
<span id="L1212" class="ln">  1212</span>	ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to
<span id="L1213" class="ln">  1213</span>	ring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.
<span id="L1214" class="ln">  1214</span>	The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
<span id="L1215" class="ln">  1215</span>	occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
<span id="L1216" class="ln">  1216</span>	Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed
<span id="L1217" class="ln">  1217</span>	next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open
<span id="L1218" class="ln">  1218</span>	window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd
<span id="L1219" class="ln">  1219</span>	filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better
<span id="L1220" class="ln">  1220</span>	days; the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other
<span id="L1221" class="ln">  1221</span>	unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,
<span id="L1222" class="ln">  1222</span>	smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her
<span id="L1223" class="ln">  1223</span>	hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and
<span id="L1224" class="ln">  1224</span>	much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg
<span id="L1225" class="ln">  1225</span>	could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer
<span id="L1226" class="ln">  1226</span>	Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the
<span id="L1227" class="ln">  1227</span>	village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young
<span id="L1228" class="ln">  1228</span>	heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body--for they
<span id="L1229" class="ln">  1229</span>	had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of
<span id="L1230" class="ln">  1230</span>	oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet;
<span id="L1231" class="ln">  1231</span>	and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful
<span id="L1232" class="ln">  1232</span>	care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his
<span id="L1233" class="ln">  1233</span>	mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all
<span id="L1234" class="ln">  1234</span>	hated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been &#34;thrown up to them&#34;
<span id="L1235" class="ln">  1235</span>	so much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as
<span id="L1236" class="ln">  1236</span>	usual on Sundays--accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked
<span id="L1237" class="ln">  1237</span>	upon boys who had as snobs.
<span id="L1238" class="ln">  1238</span>	
<span id="L1239" class="ln">  1239</span>	The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
<span id="L1240" class="ln">  1240</span>	to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
<span id="L1241" class="ln">  1241</span>	church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
<span id="L1242" class="ln">  1242</span>	choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
<span id="L1243" class="ln">  1243</span>	through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
<span id="L1244" class="ln">  1244</span>	but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
<span id="L1245" class="ln">  1245</span>	and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
<span id="L1246" class="ln">  1246</span>	some foreign country.
<span id="L1247" class="ln">  1247</span>	
<span id="L1248" class="ln">  1248</span>	The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in
<span id="L1249" class="ln">  1249</span>	a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.
<span id="L1250" class="ln">  1250</span>	His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached
<span id="L1251" class="ln">  1251</span>	a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost
<span id="L1252" class="ln">  1252</span>	word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:
<span id="L1253" class="ln">  1253</span>	
<span id="L1254" class="ln">  1254</span>	  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow&#39;ry BEDS of ease,
<span id="L1255" class="ln">  1255</span>	
<span id="L1256" class="ln">  1256</span>	  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro&#39; BLOODY seas?
<span id="L1257" class="ln">  1257</span>	
<span id="L1258" class="ln">  1258</span>	He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church &#34;sociables&#34; he was
<span id="L1259" class="ln">  1259</span>	always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
<span id="L1260" class="ln">  1260</span>	would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
<span id="L1261" class="ln">  1261</span>	and &#34;wall&#34; their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, &#34;Words
<span id="L1262" class="ln">  1262</span>	cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
<span id="L1263" class="ln">  1263</span>	earth.&#34;
<span id="L1264" class="ln">  1264</span>	
<span id="L1265" class="ln">  1265</span>	After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into
<span id="L1266" class="ln">  1266</span>	a bulletin-board, and read off &#34;notices&#34; of meetings and societies and
<span id="L1267" class="ln">  1267</span>	things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
<span id="L1268" class="ln">  1268</span>	doom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,
<span id="L1269" class="ln">  1269</span>	away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is
<span id="L1270" class="ln">  1270</span>	to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.
<span id="L1271" class="ln">  1271</span>	
<span id="L1272" class="ln">  1272</span>	And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
<span id="L1273" class="ln">  1273</span>	into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
<span id="L1274" class="ln">  1274</span>	church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
<span id="L1275" class="ln">  1275</span>	for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
<span id="L1276" class="ln">  1276</span>	States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
<span id="L1277" class="ln">  1277</span>	President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
<span id="L1278" class="ln">  1278</span>	by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
<span id="L1279" class="ln">  1279</span>	European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
<span id="L1280" class="ln">  1280</span>	and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
<span id="L1281" class="ln">  1281</span>	withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
<span id="L1282" class="ln">  1282</span>	a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
<span id="L1283" class="ln">  1283</span>	and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
<span id="L1284" class="ln">  1284</span>	grateful harvest of good. Amen.
<span id="L1285" class="ln">  1285</span>	
<span id="L1286" class="ln">  1286</span>	There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat
<span id="L1287" class="ln">  1287</span>	down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,
<span id="L1288" class="ln">  1288</span>	he only endured it--if he even did that much. He was restive all
<span id="L1289" class="ln">  1289</span>	through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously
<span id="L1290" class="ln">  1290</span>	--for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the
<span id="L1291" class="ln">  1291</span>	clergyman&#39;s regular route over it--and when a little trifle of new
<span id="L1292" class="ln">  1292</span>	matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature
<span id="L1293" class="ln">  1293</span>	resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the
<span id="L1294" class="ln">  1294</span>	midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of
<span id="L1295" class="ln">  1295</span>	him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together,
<span id="L1296" class="ln">  1296</span>	embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that
<span id="L1297" class="ln">  1297</span>	it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread
<span id="L1298" class="ln">  1298</span>	of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs
<span id="L1299" class="ln">  1299</span>	and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going
<span id="L1300" class="ln">  1300</span>	through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly
<span id="L1301" class="ln">  1301</span>	safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom&#39;s hands itched to grab for
<span id="L1302" class="ln">  1302</span>	it they did not dare--he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed
<span id="L1303" class="ln">  1303</span>	if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the
<span id="L1304" class="ln">  1304</span>	closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the
<span id="L1305" class="ln">  1305</span>	instant the &#34;Amen&#34; was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt
<span id="L1306" class="ln">  1306</span>	detected the act and made him let it go.
<span id="L1307" class="ln">  1307</span>	
<span id="L1308" class="ln">  1308</span>	The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through
<span id="L1309" class="ln">  1309</span>	an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod
<span id="L1310" class="ln">  1310</span>	--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone
<span id="L1311" class="ln">  1311</span>	and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be
<span id="L1312" class="ln">  1312</span>	hardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after
<span id="L1313" class="ln">  1313</span>	church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew
<span id="L1314" class="ln">  1314</span>	anything else about the discourse. However, this time he was really
<span id="L1315" class="ln">  1315</span>	interested for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving
<span id="L1316" class="ln">  1316</span>	picture of the assembling together of the world&#39;s hosts at the
<span id="L1317" class="ln">  1317</span>	millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a
<span id="L1318" class="ln">  1318</span>	little child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of
<span id="L1319" class="ln">  1319</span>	the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
<span id="L1320" class="ln">  1320</span>	conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking
<span id="L1321" class="ln">  1321</span>	nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he
<span id="L1322" class="ln">  1322</span>	wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.
<span id="L1323" class="ln">  1323</span>	
<span id="L1324" class="ln">  1324</span>	Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
<span id="L1325" class="ln">  1325</span>	Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was
<span id="L1326" class="ln">  1326</span>	a large black beetle with formidable jaws--a &#34;pinchbug,&#34; he called it.
<span id="L1327" class="ln">  1327</span>	It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
<span id="L1328" class="ln">  1328</span>	take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
<span id="L1329" class="ln">  1329</span>	floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger
<span id="L1330" class="ln">  1330</span>	went into the boy&#39;s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless
<span id="L1331" class="ln">  1331</span>	legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was
<span id="L1332" class="ln">  1332</span>	safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found
<span id="L1333" class="ln">  1333</span>	relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle
<span id="L1334" class="ln">  1334</span>	dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and
<span id="L1335" class="ln">  1335</span>	the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle;
<span id="L1336" class="ln">  1336</span>	the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked
<span id="L1337" class="ln">  1337</span>	around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again;
<span id="L1338" class="ln">  1338</span>	grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a
<span id="L1339" class="ln">  1339</span>	gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another;
<span id="L1340" class="ln">  1340</span>	began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle
<span id="L1341" class="ln">  1341</span>	between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last,
<span id="L1342" class="ln">  1342</span>	and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by
<span id="L1343" class="ln">  1343</span>	little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There
<span id="L1344" class="ln">  1344</span>	was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle&#39;s head, and the beetle fell a
<span id="L1345" class="ln">  1345</span>	couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring
<span id="L1346" class="ln">  1346</span>	spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind
<span id="L1347" class="ln">  1347</span>	fans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked
<span id="L1348" class="ln">  1348</span>	foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart,
<span id="L1349" class="ln">  1349</span>	too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a
<span id="L1350" class="ln">  1350</span>	wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle,
<span id="L1351" class="ln">  1351</span>	lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even
<span id="L1352" class="ln">  1352</span>	closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his
<span id="L1353" class="ln">  1353</span>	ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried
<span id="L1354" class="ln">  1354</span>	to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant
<span id="L1355" class="ln">  1355</span>	around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that;
<span id="L1356" class="ln">  1356</span>	yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then
<span id="L1357" class="ln">  1357</span>	there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the
<span id="L1358" class="ln">  1358</span>	aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in
<span id="L1359" class="ln">  1359</span>	front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the
<span id="L1360" class="ln">  1360</span>	doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his
<span id="L1361" class="ln">  1361</span>	progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit
<span id="L1362" class="ln">  1362</span>	with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer
<span id="L1363" class="ln">  1363</span>	sheered from its course, and sprang into its master&#39;s lap; he flung it
<span id="L1364" class="ln">  1364</span>	out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and
<span id="L1365" class="ln">  1365</span>	died in the distance.
<span id="L1366" class="ln">  1366</span>	
<span id="L1367" class="ln">  1367</span>	By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
<span id="L1368" class="ln">  1368</span>	suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The
<span id="L1369" class="ln">  1369</span>	discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
<span id="L1370" class="ln">  1370</span>	possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
<span id="L1371" class="ln">  1371</span>	sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
<span id="L1372" class="ln">  1372</span>	unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor
<span id="L1373" class="ln">  1373</span>	parson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to
<span id="L1374" class="ln">  1374</span>	the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction
<span id="L1375" class="ln">  1375</span>	pronounced.
<span id="L1376" class="ln">  1376</span>	
<span id="L1377" class="ln">  1377</span>	Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there
<span id="L1378" class="ln">  1378</span>	was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of
<span id="L1379" class="ln">  1379</span>	variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the
<span id="L1380" class="ln">  1380</span>	dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright
<span id="L1381" class="ln">  1381</span>	in him to carry it off.
<span id="L1382" class="ln">  1382</span>	
<span id="L1383" class="ln">  1383</span>	
<span id="L1384" class="ln">  1384</span>	
<span id="L1385" class="ln">  1385</span>	CHAPTER VI
<span id="L1386" class="ln">  1386</span>	
<span id="L1387" class="ln">  1387</span>	MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
<span id="L1388" class="ln">  1388</span>	him so--because it began another week&#39;s slow suffering in school. He
<span id="L1389" class="ln">  1389</span>	generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening
<span id="L1390" class="ln">  1390</span>	holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much
<span id="L1391" class="ln">  1391</span>	more odious.
<span id="L1392" class="ln">  1392</span>	
<span id="L1393" class="ln">  1393</span>	Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
<span id="L1394" class="ln">  1394</span>	sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague
<span id="L1395" class="ln">  1395</span>	possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he
<span id="L1396" class="ln">  1396</span>	investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky
<span id="L1397" class="ln">  1397</span>	symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But
<span id="L1398" class="ln">  1398</span>	they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected
<span id="L1399" class="ln">  1399</span>	further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth
<span id="L1400" class="ln">  1400</span>	was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a
<span id="L1401" class="ln">  1401</span>	&#34;starter,&#34; as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came
<span id="L1402" class="ln">  1402</span>	into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that
<span id="L1403" class="ln">  1403</span>	would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the
<span id="L1404" class="ln">  1404</span>	present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and
<span id="L1405" class="ln">  1405</span>	then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that
<span id="L1406" class="ln">  1406</span>	laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him
<span id="L1407" class="ln">  1407</span>	lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the
<span id="L1408" class="ln">  1408</span>	sheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did not know the
<span id="L1409" class="ln">  1409</span>	necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to chance it,
<span id="L1410" class="ln">  1410</span>	so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.
<span id="L1411" class="ln">  1411</span>	
<span id="L1412" class="ln">  1412</span>	But Sid slept on unconscious.
<span id="L1413" class="ln">  1413</span>	
<span id="L1414" class="ln">  1414</span>	Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.
<span id="L1415" class="ln">  1415</span>	
<span id="L1416" class="ln">  1416</span>	No result from Sid.
<span id="L1417" class="ln">  1417</span>	
<span id="L1418" class="ln">  1418</span>	Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and
<span id="L1419" class="ln">  1419</span>	then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.
<span id="L1420" class="ln">  1420</span>	
<span id="L1421" class="ln">  1421</span>	Sid snored on.
<span id="L1422" class="ln">  1422</span>	
<span id="L1423" class="ln">  1423</span>	Tom was aggravated. He said, &#34;Sid, Sid!&#34; and shook him. This course
<span id="L1424" class="ln">  1424</span>	worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
<span id="L1425" class="ln">  1425</span>	brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at
<span id="L1426" class="ln">  1426</span>	Tom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:
<span id="L1427" class="ln">  1427</span>	
<span id="L1428" class="ln">  1428</span>	&#34;Tom! Say, Tom!&#34; [No response.] &#34;Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,
<span id="L1429" class="ln">  1429</span>	Tom?&#34; And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.
<span id="L1430" class="ln">  1430</span>	
<span id="L1431" class="ln">  1431</span>	Tom moaned out:
<span id="L1432" class="ln">  1432</span>	
<span id="L1433" class="ln">  1433</span>	&#34;Oh, don&#39;t, Sid. Don&#39;t joggle me.&#34;
<span id="L1434" class="ln">  1434</span>	
<span id="L1435" class="ln">  1435</span>	&#34;Why, what&#39;s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.&#34;
<span id="L1436" class="ln">  1436</span>	
<span id="L1437" class="ln">  1437</span>	&#34;No--never mind. It&#39;ll be over by and by, maybe. Don&#39;t call anybody.&#34;
<span id="L1438" class="ln">  1438</span>	
<span id="L1439" class="ln">  1439</span>	&#34;But I must! DON&#39;T groan so, Tom, it&#39;s awful. How long you been this
<span id="L1440" class="ln">  1440</span>	way?&#34;
<span id="L1441" class="ln">  1441</span>	
<span id="L1442" class="ln">  1442</span>	&#34;Hours. Ouch! Oh, don&#39;t stir so, Sid, you&#39;ll kill me.&#34;
<span id="L1443" class="ln">  1443</span>	
<span id="L1444" class="ln">  1444</span>	&#34;Tom, why didn&#39;t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, DON&#39;T! It makes my
<span id="L1445" class="ln">  1445</span>	flesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?&#34;
<span id="L1446" class="ln">  1446</span>	
<span id="L1447" class="ln">  1447</span>	&#34;I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you&#39;ve ever done
<span id="L1448" class="ln">  1448</span>	to me. When I&#39;m gone--&#34;
<span id="L1449" class="ln">  1449</span>	
<span id="L1450" class="ln">  1450</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom, you ain&#39;t dying, are you? Don&#39;t, Tom--oh, don&#39;t. Maybe--&#34;
<span id="L1451" class="ln">  1451</span>	
<span id="L1452" class="ln">  1452</span>	&#34;I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell &#39;em so, Sid. And Sid, you
<span id="L1453" class="ln">  1453</span>	give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that&#39;s
<span id="L1454" class="ln">  1454</span>	come to town, and tell her--&#34;
<span id="L1455" class="ln">  1455</span>	
<span id="L1456" class="ln">  1456</span>	But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in
<span id="L1457" class="ln">  1457</span>	reality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his
<span id="L1458" class="ln">  1458</span>	groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.
<span id="L1459" class="ln">  1459</span>	
<span id="L1460" class="ln">  1460</span>	Sid flew down-stairs and said:
<span id="L1461" class="ln">  1461</span>	
<span id="L1462" class="ln">  1462</span>	&#34;Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom&#39;s dying!&#34;
<span id="L1463" class="ln">  1463</span>	
<span id="L1464" class="ln">  1464</span>	&#34;Dying!&#34;
<span id="L1465" class="ln">  1465</span>	
<span id="L1466" class="ln">  1466</span>	&#34;Yes&#39;m. Don&#39;t wait--come quick!&#34;
<span id="L1467" class="ln">  1467</span>	
<span id="L1468" class="ln">  1468</span>	&#34;Rubbage! I don&#39;t believe it!&#34;
<span id="L1469" class="ln">  1469</span>	
<span id="L1470" class="ln">  1470</span>	But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.
<span id="L1471" class="ln">  1471</span>	And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached
<span id="L1472" class="ln">  1472</span>	the bedside she gasped out:
<span id="L1473" class="ln">  1473</span>	
<span id="L1474" class="ln">  1474</span>	&#34;You, Tom! Tom, what&#39;s the matter with you?&#34;
<span id="L1475" class="ln">  1475</span>	
<span id="L1476" class="ln">  1476</span>	&#34;Oh, auntie, I&#39;m--&#34;
<span id="L1477" class="ln">  1477</span>	
<span id="L1478" class="ln">  1478</span>	&#34;What&#39;s the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?&#34;
<span id="L1479" class="ln">  1479</span>	
<span id="L1480" class="ln">  1480</span>	&#34;Oh, auntie, my sore toe&#39;s mortified!&#34;
<span id="L1481" class="ln">  1481</span>	
<span id="L1482" class="ln">  1482</span>	The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
<span id="L1483" class="ln">  1483</span>	little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:
<span id="L1484" class="ln">  1484</span>	
<span id="L1485" class="ln">  1485</span>	&#34;Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
<span id="L1486" class="ln">  1486</span>	climb out of this.&#34;
<span id="L1487" class="ln">  1487</span>	
<span id="L1488" class="ln">  1488</span>	The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
<span id="L1489" class="ln">  1489</span>	little foolish, and he said:
<span id="L1490" class="ln">  1490</span>	
<span id="L1491" class="ln">  1491</span>	&#34;Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my
<span id="L1492" class="ln">  1492</span>	tooth at all.&#34;
<span id="L1493" class="ln">  1493</span>	
<span id="L1494" class="ln">  1494</span>	&#34;Your tooth, indeed! What&#39;s the matter with your tooth?&#34;
<span id="L1495" class="ln">  1495</span>	
<span id="L1496" class="ln">  1496</span>	&#34;One of them&#39;s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.&#34;
<span id="L1497" class="ln">  1497</span>	
<span id="L1498" class="ln">  1498</span>	&#34;There, there, now, don&#39;t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
<span id="L1499" class="ln">  1499</span>	Well--your tooth IS loose, but you&#39;re not going to die about that.
<span id="L1500" class="ln">  1500</span>	Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.&#34;
<span id="L1501" class="ln">  1501</span>	
<span id="L1502" class="ln">  1502</span>	Tom said:
<span id="L1503" class="ln">  1503</span>	
<span id="L1504" class="ln">  1504</span>	&#34;Oh, please, auntie, don&#39;t pull it out. It don&#39;t hurt any more. I wish
<span id="L1505" class="ln">  1505</span>	I may never stir if it does. Please don&#39;t, auntie. I don&#39;t want to stay
<span id="L1506" class="ln">  1506</span>	home from school.&#34;
<span id="L1507" class="ln">  1507</span>	
<span id="L1508" class="ln">  1508</span>	&#34;Oh, you don&#39;t, don&#39;t you? So all this row was because you thought
<span id="L1509" class="ln">  1509</span>	you&#39;d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love
<span id="L1510" class="ln">  1510</span>	you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart
<span id="L1511" class="ln">  1511</span>	with your outrageousness.&#34; By this time the dental instruments were
<span id="L1512" class="ln">  1512</span>	ready. The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom&#39;s tooth
<span id="L1513" class="ln">  1513</span>	with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the
<span id="L1514" class="ln">  1514</span>	chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy&#39;s face. The
<span id="L1515" class="ln">  1515</span>	tooth hung dangling by the bedpost, now.
<span id="L1516" class="ln">  1516</span>	
<span id="L1517" class="ln">  1517</span>	But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school
<span id="L1518" class="ln">  1518</span>	after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in
<span id="L1519" class="ln">  1519</span>	his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and
<span id="L1520" class="ln">  1520</span>	admirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the
<span id="L1521" class="ln">  1521</span>	exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of
<span id="L1522" class="ln">  1522</span>	fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly
<span id="L1523" class="ln">  1523</span>	without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and
<span id="L1524" class="ln">  1524</span>	he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn&#39;t anything to
<span id="L1525" class="ln">  1525</span>	spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, &#34;Sour grapes!&#34; and he
<span id="L1526" class="ln">  1526</span>	wandered away a dismantled hero.
<span id="L1527" class="ln">  1527</span>	
<span id="L1528" class="ln">  1528</span>	Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
<span id="L1529" class="ln">  1529</span>	Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and
<span id="L1530" class="ln">  1530</span>	dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
<span id="L1531" class="ln">  1531</span>	and vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and
<span id="L1532" class="ln">  1532</span>	delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
<span id="L1533" class="ln">  1533</span>	him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
<span id="L1534" class="ln">  1534</span>	Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders
<span id="L1535" class="ln">  1535</span>	not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
<span id="L1536" class="ln">  1536</span>	Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
<span id="L1537" class="ln">  1537</span>	men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat
<span id="L1538" class="ln">  1538</span>	was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
<span id="L1539" class="ln">  1539</span>	when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
<span id="L1540" class="ln">  1540</span>	far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat
<span id="L1541" class="ln">  1541</span>	of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs
<span id="L1542" class="ln">  1542</span>	dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.
<span id="L1543" class="ln">  1543</span>	
<span id="L1544" class="ln">  1544</span>	Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
<span id="L1545" class="ln">  1545</span>	in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
<span id="L1546" class="ln">  1546</span>	school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
<span id="L1547" class="ln">  1547</span>	go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
<span id="L1548" class="ln">  1548</span>	suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
<span id="L1549" class="ln">  1549</span>	pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
<span id="L1550" class="ln">  1550</span>	and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor
<span id="L1551" class="ln">  1551</span>	put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
<span id="L1552" class="ln">  1552</span>	that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every
<span id="L1553" class="ln">  1553</span>	harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.
<span id="L1554" class="ln">  1554</span>	
<span id="L1555" class="ln">  1555</span>	Tom hailed the romantic outcast:
<span id="L1556" class="ln">  1556</span>	
<span id="L1557" class="ln">  1557</span>	&#34;Hello, Huckleberry!&#34;
<span id="L1558" class="ln">  1558</span>	
<span id="L1559" class="ln">  1559</span>	&#34;Hello yourself, and see how you like it.&#34;
<span id="L1560" class="ln">  1560</span>	
<span id="L1561" class="ln">  1561</span>	&#34;What&#39;s that you got?&#34;
<span id="L1562" class="ln">  1562</span>	
<span id="L1563" class="ln">  1563</span>	&#34;Dead cat.&#34;
<span id="L1564" class="ln">  1564</span>	
<span id="L1565" class="ln">  1565</span>	&#34;Lemme see him, Huck. My, he&#39;s pretty stiff. Where&#39;d you get him?&#34;
<span id="L1566" class="ln">  1566</span>	
<span id="L1567" class="ln">  1567</span>	&#34;Bought him off&#39;n a boy.&#34;
<span id="L1568" class="ln">  1568</span>	
<span id="L1569" class="ln">  1569</span>	&#34;What did you give?&#34;
<span id="L1570" class="ln">  1570</span>	
<span id="L1571" class="ln">  1571</span>	&#34;I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.&#34;
<span id="L1572" class="ln">  1572</span>	
<span id="L1573" class="ln">  1573</span>	&#34;Where&#39;d you get the blue ticket?&#34;
<span id="L1574" class="ln">  1574</span>	
<span id="L1575" class="ln">  1575</span>	&#34;Bought it off&#39;n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.&#34;
<span id="L1576" class="ln">  1576</span>	
<span id="L1577" class="ln">  1577</span>	&#34;Say--what is dead cats good for, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L1578" class="ln">  1578</span>	
<span id="L1579" class="ln">  1579</span>	&#34;Good for? Cure warts with.&#34;
<span id="L1580" class="ln">  1580</span>	
<span id="L1581" class="ln">  1581</span>	&#34;No! Is that so? I know something that&#39;s better.&#34;
<span id="L1582" class="ln">  1582</span>	
<span id="L1583" class="ln">  1583</span>	&#34;I bet you don&#39;t. What is it?&#34;
<span id="L1584" class="ln">  1584</span>	
<span id="L1585" class="ln">  1585</span>	&#34;Why, spunk-water.&#34;
<span id="L1586" class="ln">  1586</span>	
<span id="L1587" class="ln">  1587</span>	&#34;Spunk-water! I wouldn&#39;t give a dern for spunk-water.&#34;
<span id="L1588" class="ln">  1588</span>	
<span id="L1589" class="ln">  1589</span>	&#34;You wouldn&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t you? D&#39;you ever try it?&#34;
<span id="L1590" class="ln">  1590</span>	
<span id="L1591" class="ln">  1591</span>	&#34;No, I hain&#39;t. But Bob Tanner did.&#34;
<span id="L1592" class="ln">  1592</span>	
<span id="L1593" class="ln">  1593</span>	&#34;Who told you so!&#34;
<span id="L1594" class="ln">  1594</span>	
<span id="L1595" class="ln">  1595</span>	&#34;Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
<span id="L1596" class="ln">  1596</span>	told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and
<span id="L1597" class="ln">  1597</span>	the nigger told me. There now!&#34;
<span id="L1598" class="ln">  1598</span>	
<span id="L1599" class="ln">  1599</span>	&#34;Well, what of it? They&#39;ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I
<span id="L1600" class="ln">  1600</span>	don&#39;t know HIM. But I never see a nigger that WOULDN&#39;T lie. Shucks! Now
<span id="L1601" class="ln">  1601</span>	you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L1602" class="ln">  1602</span>	
<span id="L1603" class="ln">  1603</span>	&#34;Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the
<span id="L1604" class="ln">  1604</span>	rain-water was.&#34;
<span id="L1605" class="ln">  1605</span>	
<span id="L1606" class="ln">  1606</span>	&#34;In the daytime?&#34;
<span id="L1607" class="ln">  1607</span>	
<span id="L1608" class="ln">  1608</span>	&#34;Certainly.&#34;
<span id="L1609" class="ln">  1609</span>	
<span id="L1610" class="ln">  1610</span>	&#34;With his face to the stump?&#34;
<span id="L1611" class="ln">  1611</span>	
<span id="L1612" class="ln">  1612</span>	&#34;Yes. Least I reckon so.&#34;
<span id="L1613" class="ln">  1613</span>	
<span id="L1614" class="ln">  1614</span>	&#34;Did he say anything?&#34;
<span id="L1615" class="ln">  1615</span>	
<span id="L1616" class="ln">  1616</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t reckon he did. I don&#39;t know.&#34;
<span id="L1617" class="ln">  1617</span>	
<span id="L1618" class="ln">  1618</span>	&#34;Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame
<span id="L1619" class="ln">  1619</span>	fool way as that! Why, that ain&#39;t a-going to do any good. You got to go
<span id="L1620" class="ln">  1620</span>	all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there&#39;s a
<span id="L1621" class="ln">  1621</span>	spunk-water stump, and just as it&#39;s midnight you back up against the
<span id="L1622" class="ln">  1622</span>	stump and jam your hand in and say:
<span id="L1623" class="ln">  1623</span>	
<span id="L1624" class="ln">  1624</span>	  &#39;Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,
<span id="L1625" class="ln">  1625</span>	   Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,&#39;
<span id="L1626" class="ln">  1626</span>	
<span id="L1627" class="ln">  1627</span>	and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then
<span id="L1628" class="ln">  1628</span>	turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
<span id="L1629" class="ln">  1629</span>	Because if you speak the charm&#39;s busted.&#34;
<span id="L1630" class="ln">  1630</span>	
<span id="L1631" class="ln">  1631</span>	&#34;Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain&#39;t the way Bob Tanner
<span id="L1632" class="ln">  1632</span>	done.&#34;
<span id="L1633" class="ln">  1633</span>	
<span id="L1634" class="ln">  1634</span>	&#34;No, sir, you can bet he didn&#39;t, becuz he&#39;s the wartiest boy in this
<span id="L1635" class="ln">  1635</span>	town; and he wouldn&#39;t have a wart on him if he&#39;d knowed how to work
<span id="L1636" class="ln">  1636</span>	spunk-water. I&#39;ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
<span id="L1637" class="ln">  1637</span>	Huck. I play with frogs so much that I&#39;ve always got considerable many
<span id="L1638" class="ln">  1638</span>	warts. Sometimes I take &#39;em off with a bean.&#34;
<span id="L1639" class="ln">  1639</span>	
<span id="L1640" class="ln">  1640</span>	&#34;Yes, bean&#39;s good. I&#39;ve done that.&#34;
<span id="L1641" class="ln">  1641</span>	
<span id="L1642" class="ln">  1642</span>	&#34;Have you? What&#39;s your way?&#34;
<span id="L1643" class="ln">  1643</span>	
<span id="L1644" class="ln">  1644</span>	&#34;You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some
<span id="L1645" class="ln">  1645</span>	blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and
<span id="L1646" class="ln">  1646</span>	dig a hole and bury it &#39;bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of
<span id="L1647" class="ln">  1647</span>	the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece
<span id="L1648" class="ln">  1648</span>	that&#39;s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to
<span id="L1649" class="ln">  1649</span>	fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the
<span id="L1650" class="ln">  1650</span>	wart, and pretty soon off she comes.&#34;
<span id="L1651" class="ln">  1651</span>	
<span id="L1652" class="ln">  1652</span>	&#34;Yes, that&#39;s it, Huck--that&#39;s it; though when you&#39;re burying it if you
<span id="L1653" class="ln">  1653</span>	say &#39;Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!&#39; it&#39;s better.
<span id="L1654" class="ln">  1654</span>	That&#39;s the way Joe Harper does, and he&#39;s been nearly to Coonville and
<span id="L1655" class="ln">  1655</span>	most everywheres. But say--how do you cure &#39;em with dead cats?&#34;
<span id="L1656" class="ln">  1656</span>	
<span id="L1657" class="ln">  1657</span>	&#34;Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard &#39;long about
<span id="L1658" class="ln">  1658</span>	midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it&#39;s
<span id="L1659" class="ln">  1659</span>	midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can&#39;t see
<span id="L1660" class="ln">  1660</span>	&#39;em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear &#39;em talk;
<span id="L1661" class="ln">  1661</span>	and when they&#39;re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after &#39;em
<span id="L1662" class="ln">  1662</span>	and say, &#39;Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I&#39;m
<span id="L1663" class="ln">  1663</span>	done with ye!&#39; That&#39;ll fetch ANY wart.&#34;
<span id="L1664" class="ln">  1664</span>	
<span id="L1665" class="ln">  1665</span>	&#34;Sounds right. D&#39;you ever try it, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L1666" class="ln">  1666</span>	
<span id="L1667" class="ln">  1667</span>	&#34;No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.&#34;
<span id="L1668" class="ln">  1668</span>	
<span id="L1669" class="ln">  1669</span>	&#34;Well, I reckon it&#39;s so, then. Becuz they say she&#39;s a witch.&#34;
<span id="L1670" class="ln">  1670</span>	
<span id="L1671" class="ln">  1671</span>	&#34;Say! Why, Tom, I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own
<span id="L1672" class="ln">  1672</span>	self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
<span id="L1673" class="ln">  1673</span>	took up a rock, and if she hadn&#39;t dodged, he&#39;d a got her. Well, that
<span id="L1674" class="ln">  1674</span>	very night he rolled off&#39;n a shed wher&#39; he was a layin drunk, and broke
<span id="L1675" class="ln">  1675</span>	his arm.&#34;
<span id="L1676" class="ln">  1676</span>	
<span id="L1677" class="ln">  1677</span>	&#34;Why, that&#39;s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?&#34;
<span id="L1678" class="ln">  1678</span>	
<span id="L1679" class="ln">  1679</span>	&#34;Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you
<span id="L1680" class="ln">  1680</span>	right stiddy, they&#39;re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz
<span id="L1681" class="ln">  1681</span>	when they mumble they&#39;re saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer backards.&#34;
<span id="L1682" class="ln">  1682</span>	
<span id="L1683" class="ln">  1683</span>	&#34;Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?&#34;
<span id="L1684" class="ln">  1684</span>	
<span id="L1685" class="ln">  1685</span>	&#34;To-night. I reckon they&#39;ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.&#34;
<span id="L1686" class="ln">  1686</span>	
<span id="L1687" class="ln">  1687</span>	&#34;But they buried him Saturday. Didn&#39;t they get him Saturday night?&#34;
<span id="L1688" class="ln">  1688</span>	
<span id="L1689" class="ln">  1689</span>	&#34;Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?--and
<span id="L1690" class="ln">  1690</span>	THEN it&#39;s Sunday. Devils don&#39;t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don&#39;t
<span id="L1691" class="ln">  1691</span>	reckon.&#34;
<span id="L1692" class="ln">  1692</span>	
<span id="L1693" class="ln">  1693</span>	&#34;I never thought of that. That&#39;s so. Lemme go with you?&#34;
<span id="L1694" class="ln">  1694</span>	
<span id="L1695" class="ln">  1695</span>	&#34;Of course--if you ain&#39;t afeard.&#34;
<span id="L1696" class="ln">  1696</span>	
<span id="L1697" class="ln">  1697</span>	&#34;Afeard! &#39;Tain&#39;t likely. Will you meow?&#34;
<span id="L1698" class="ln">  1698</span>	
<span id="L1699" class="ln">  1699</span>	&#34;Yes--and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep&#39; me
<span id="L1700" class="ln">  1700</span>	a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
<span id="L1701" class="ln">  1701</span>	&#39;Dern that cat!&#39; and so I hove a brick through his window--but don&#39;t
<span id="L1702" class="ln">  1702</span>	you tell.&#34;
<span id="L1703" class="ln">  1703</span>	
<span id="L1704" class="ln">  1704</span>	&#34;I won&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me,
<span id="L1705" class="ln">  1705</span>	but I&#39;ll meow this time. Say--what&#39;s that?&#34;
<span id="L1706" class="ln">  1706</span>	
<span id="L1707" class="ln">  1707</span>	&#34;Nothing but a tick.&#34;
<span id="L1708" class="ln">  1708</span>	
<span id="L1709" class="ln">  1709</span>	&#34;Where&#39;d you get him?&#34;
<span id="L1710" class="ln">  1710</span>	
<span id="L1711" class="ln">  1711</span>	&#34;Out in the woods.&#34;
<span id="L1712" class="ln">  1712</span>	
<span id="L1713" class="ln">  1713</span>	&#34;What&#39;ll you take for him?&#34;
<span id="L1714" class="ln">  1714</span>	
<span id="L1715" class="ln">  1715</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t want to sell him.&#34;
<span id="L1716" class="ln">  1716</span>	
<span id="L1717" class="ln">  1717</span>	&#34;All right. It&#39;s a mighty small tick, anyway.&#34;
<span id="L1718" class="ln">  1718</span>	
<span id="L1719" class="ln">  1719</span>	&#34;Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don&#39;t belong to them. I&#39;m
<span id="L1720" class="ln">  1720</span>	satisfied with it. It&#39;s a good enough tick for me.&#34;
<span id="L1721" class="ln">  1721</span>	
<span id="L1722" class="ln">  1722</span>	&#34;Sho, there&#39;s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of &#39;em if I
<span id="L1723" class="ln">  1723</span>	wanted to.&#34;
<span id="L1724" class="ln">  1724</span>	
<span id="L1725" class="ln">  1725</span>	&#34;Well, why don&#39;t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can&#39;t. This is a
<span id="L1726" class="ln">  1726</span>	pretty early tick, I reckon. It&#39;s the first one I&#39;ve seen this year.&#34;
<span id="L1727" class="ln">  1727</span>	
<span id="L1728" class="ln">  1728</span>	&#34;Say, Huck--I&#39;ll give you my tooth for him.&#34;
<span id="L1729" class="ln">  1729</span>	
<span id="L1730" class="ln">  1730</span>	&#34;Less see it.&#34;
<span id="L1731" class="ln">  1731</span>	
<span id="L1732" class="ln">  1732</span>	Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry
<span id="L1733" class="ln">  1733</span>	viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:
<span id="L1734" class="ln">  1734</span>	
<span id="L1735" class="ln">  1735</span>	&#34;Is it genuwyne?&#34;
<span id="L1736" class="ln">  1736</span>	
<span id="L1737" class="ln">  1737</span>	Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
<span id="L1738" class="ln">  1738</span>	
<span id="L1739" class="ln">  1739</span>	&#34;Well, all right,&#34; said Huckleberry, &#34;it&#39;s a trade.&#34;
<span id="L1740" class="ln">  1740</span>	
<span id="L1741" class="ln">  1741</span>	Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been
<span id="L1742" class="ln">  1742</span>	the pinchbug&#39;s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier
<span id="L1743" class="ln">  1743</span>	than before.
<span id="L1744" class="ln">  1744</span>	
<span id="L1745" class="ln">  1745</span>	When Tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse, he strode in
<span id="L1746" class="ln">  1746</span>	briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed.
<span id="L1747" class="ln">  1747</span>	He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with
<span id="L1748" class="ln">  1748</span>	business-like alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great
<span id="L1749" class="ln">  1749</span>	splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study.
<span id="L1750" class="ln">  1750</span>	The interruption roused him.
<span id="L1751" class="ln">  1751</span>	
<span id="L1752" class="ln">  1752</span>	&#34;Thomas Sawyer!&#34;
<span id="L1753" class="ln">  1753</span>	
<span id="L1754" class="ln">  1754</span>	Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.
<span id="L1755" class="ln">  1755</span>	
<span id="L1756" class="ln">  1756</span>	&#34;Sir!&#34;
<span id="L1757" class="ln">  1757</span>	
<span id="L1758" class="ln">  1758</span>	&#34;Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?&#34;
<span id="L1759" class="ln">  1759</span>	
<span id="L1760" class="ln">  1760</span>	Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
<span id="L1761" class="ln">  1761</span>	yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
<span id="L1762" class="ln">  1762</span>	sympathy of love; and by that form was THE ONLY VACANT PLACE on the
<span id="L1763" class="ln">  1763</span>	girls&#39; side of the schoolhouse. He instantly said:
<span id="L1764" class="ln">  1764</span>	
<span id="L1765" class="ln">  1765</span>	&#34;I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!&#34;
<span id="L1766" class="ln">  1766</span>	
<span id="L1767" class="ln">  1767</span>	The master&#39;s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
<span id="L1768" class="ln">  1768</span>	study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
<span id="L1769" class="ln">  1769</span>	mind. The master said:
<span id="L1770" class="ln">  1770</span>	
<span id="L1771" class="ln">  1771</span>	&#34;You--you did what?&#34;
<span id="L1772" class="ln">  1772</span>	
<span id="L1773" class="ln">  1773</span>	&#34;Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.&#34;
<span id="L1774" class="ln">  1774</span>	
<span id="L1775" class="ln">  1775</span>	There was no mistaking the words.
<span id="L1776" class="ln">  1776</span>	
<span id="L1777" class="ln">  1777</span>	&#34;Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
<span id="L1778" class="ln">  1778</span>	listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
<span id="L1779" class="ln">  1779</span>	jacket.&#34;
<span id="L1780" class="ln">  1780</span>	
<span id="L1781" class="ln">  1781</span>	The master&#39;s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of
<span id="L1782" class="ln">  1782</span>	switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:
<span id="L1783" class="ln">  1783</span>	
<span id="L1784" class="ln">  1784</span>	&#34;Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.&#34;
<span id="L1785" class="ln">  1785</span>	
<span id="L1786" class="ln">  1786</span>	The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but
<span id="L1787" class="ln">  1787</span>	in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of
<span id="L1788" class="ln">  1788</span>	his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
<span id="L1789" class="ln">  1789</span>	fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl
<span id="L1790" class="ln">  1790</span>	hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks
<span id="L1791" class="ln">  1791</span>	and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon
<span id="L1792" class="ln">  1792</span>	the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.
<span id="L1793" class="ln">  1793</span>	
<span id="L1794" class="ln">  1794</span>	By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
<span id="L1795" class="ln">  1795</span>	rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal
<span id="L1796" class="ln">  1796</span>	furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, &#34;made a mouth&#34; at him and
<span id="L1797" class="ln">  1797</span>	gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she
<span id="L1798" class="ln">  1798</span>	cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it
<span id="L1799" class="ln">  1799</span>	away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less
<span id="L1800" class="ln">  1800</span>	animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it
<span id="L1801" class="ln">  1801</span>	remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, &#34;Please take it--I got more.&#34; The
<span id="L1802" class="ln">  1802</span>	girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw
<span id="L1803" class="ln">  1803</span>	something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time
<span id="L1804" class="ln">  1804</span>	the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to
<span id="L1805" class="ln">  1805</span>	manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
<span id="L1806" class="ln">  1806</span>	apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to
<span id="L1807" class="ln">  1807</span>	see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she
<span id="L1808" class="ln">  1808</span>	gave in and hesitatingly whispered:
<span id="L1809" class="ln">  1809</span>	
<span id="L1810" class="ln">  1810</span>	&#34;Let me see it.&#34;
<span id="L1811" class="ln">  1811</span>	
<span id="L1812" class="ln">  1812</span>	Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable
<span id="L1813" class="ln">  1813</span>	ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the
<span id="L1814" class="ln">  1814</span>	girl&#39;s interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot
<span id="L1815" class="ln">  1815</span>	everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then
<span id="L1816" class="ln">  1816</span>	whispered:
<span id="L1817" class="ln">  1817</span>	
<span id="L1818" class="ln">  1818</span>	&#34;It&#39;s nice--make a man.&#34;
<span id="L1819" class="ln">  1819</span>	
<span id="L1820" class="ln">  1820</span>	The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick.
<span id="L1821" class="ln">  1821</span>	He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not
<span id="L1822" class="ln">  1822</span>	hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:
<span id="L1823" class="ln">  1823</span>	
<span id="L1824" class="ln">  1824</span>	&#34;It&#39;s a beautiful man--now make me coming along.&#34;
<span id="L1825" class="ln">  1825</span>	
<span id="L1826" class="ln">  1826</span>	Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and
<span id="L1827" class="ln">  1827</span>	armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:
<span id="L1828" class="ln">  1828</span>	
<span id="L1829" class="ln">  1829</span>	&#34;It&#39;s ever so nice--I wish I could draw.&#34;
<span id="L1830" class="ln">  1830</span>	
<span id="L1831" class="ln">  1831</span>	&#34;It&#39;s easy,&#34; whispered Tom, &#34;I&#39;ll learn you.&#34;
<span id="L1832" class="ln">  1832</span>	
<span id="L1833" class="ln">  1833</span>	&#34;Oh, will you? When?&#34;
<span id="L1834" class="ln">  1834</span>	
<span id="L1835" class="ln">  1835</span>	&#34;At noon. Do you go home to dinner?&#34;
<span id="L1836" class="ln">  1836</span>	
<span id="L1837" class="ln">  1837</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll stay if you will.&#34;
<span id="L1838" class="ln">  1838</span>	
<span id="L1839" class="ln">  1839</span>	&#34;Good--that&#39;s a whack. What&#39;s your name?&#34;
<span id="L1840" class="ln">  1840</span>	
<span id="L1841" class="ln">  1841</span>	&#34;Becky Thatcher. What&#39;s yours? Oh, I know. It&#39;s Thomas Sawyer.&#34;
<span id="L1842" class="ln">  1842</span>	
<span id="L1843" class="ln">  1843</span>	&#34;That&#39;s the name they lick me by. I&#39;m Tom when I&#39;m good. You call me
<span id="L1844" class="ln">  1844</span>	Tom, will you?&#34;
<span id="L1845" class="ln">  1845</span>	
<span id="L1846" class="ln">  1846</span>	&#34;Yes.&#34;
<span id="L1847" class="ln">  1847</span>	
<span id="L1848" class="ln">  1848</span>	Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from
<span id="L1849" class="ln">  1849</span>	the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom
<span id="L1850" class="ln">  1850</span>	said:
<span id="L1851" class="ln">  1851</span>	
<span id="L1852" class="ln">  1852</span>	&#34;Oh, it ain&#39;t anything.&#34;
<span id="L1853" class="ln">  1853</span>	
<span id="L1854" class="ln">  1854</span>	&#34;Yes it is.&#34;
<span id="L1855" class="ln">  1855</span>	
<span id="L1856" class="ln">  1856</span>	&#34;No it ain&#39;t. You don&#39;t want to see.&#34;
<span id="L1857" class="ln">  1857</span>	
<span id="L1858" class="ln">  1858</span>	&#34;Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.&#34;
<span id="L1859" class="ln">  1859</span>	
<span id="L1860" class="ln">  1860</span>	&#34;You&#39;ll tell.&#34;
<span id="L1861" class="ln">  1861</span>	
<span id="L1862" class="ln">  1862</span>	&#34;No I won&#39;t--deed and deed and double deed won&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L1863" class="ln">  1863</span>	
<span id="L1864" class="ln">  1864</span>	&#34;You won&#39;t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?&#34;
<span id="L1865" class="ln">  1865</span>	
<span id="L1866" class="ln">  1866</span>	&#34;No, I won&#39;t ever tell ANYbody. Now let me.&#34;
<span id="L1867" class="ln">  1867</span>	
<span id="L1868" class="ln">  1868</span>	&#34;Oh, YOU don&#39;t want to see!&#34;
<span id="L1869" class="ln">  1869</span>	
<span id="L1870" class="ln">  1870</span>	&#34;Now that you treat me so, I WILL see.&#34; And she put her small hand
<span id="L1871" class="ln">  1871</span>	upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
<span id="L1872" class="ln">  1872</span>	earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
<span id="L1873" class="ln">  1873</span>	revealed: &#34;I LOVE YOU.&#34;
<span id="L1874" class="ln">  1874</span>	
<span id="L1875" class="ln">  1875</span>	&#34;Oh, you bad thing!&#34; And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened
<span id="L1876" class="ln">  1876</span>	and looked pleased, nevertheless.
<span id="L1877" class="ln">  1877</span>	
<span id="L1878" class="ln">  1878</span>	Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
<span id="L1879" class="ln">  1879</span>	ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the
<span id="L1880" class="ln">  1880</span>	house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles
<span id="L1881" class="ln">  1881</span>	from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few
<span id="L1882" class="ln">  1882</span>	awful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a
<span id="L1883" class="ln">  1883</span>	word. But although Tom&#39;s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.

<span id="L1885" class="ln">  1885</span>	As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the
<span id="L1886" class="ln">  1886</span>	turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the
<span id="L1887" class="ln">  1887</span>	reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and
<span id="L1888" class="ln">  1888</span>	turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into
<span id="L1889" class="ln">  1889</span>	continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and
<span id="L1890" class="ln">  1890</span>	got &#34;turned down,&#34; by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought
<span id="L1891" class="ln">  1891</span>	up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
<span id="L1892" class="ln">  1892</span>	ostentation for months.
<span id="L1893" class="ln">  1893</span>	
<span id="L1894" class="ln">  1894</span>	
<span id="L1895" class="ln">  1895</span>	
<span id="L1896" class="ln">  1896</span>	CHAPTER VII
<span id="L1897" class="ln">  1897</span>	
<span id="L1898" class="ln">  1898</span>	THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his
<span id="L1899" class="ln">  1899</span>	ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It
<span id="L1900" class="ln">  1900</span>	seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was
<span id="L1901" class="ln">  1901</span>	utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of
<span id="L1902" class="ln">  1902</span>	sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying
<span id="L1903" class="ln">  1903</span>	scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.
<span id="L1904" class="ln">  1904</span>	Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green
<span id="L1905" class="ln">  1905</span>	sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of
<span id="L1906" class="ln">  1906</span>	distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other
<span id="L1907" class="ln">  1907</span>	living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom&#39;s
<span id="L1908" class="ln">  1908</span>	heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to
<span id="L1909" class="ln">  1909</span>	pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face
<span id="L1910" class="ln">  1910</span>	lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know
<span id="L1911" class="ln">  1911</span>	it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the
<span id="L1912" class="ln">  1912</span>	tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed
<span id="L1913" class="ln">  1913</span>	with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it
<span id="L1914" class="ln">  1914</span>	was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned
<span id="L1915" class="ln">  1915</span>	him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.
<span id="L1916" class="ln">  1916</span>	
<span id="L1917" class="ln">  1917</span>	Tom&#39;s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and
<span id="L1918" class="ln">  1918</span>	now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an
<span id="L1919" class="ln">  1919</span>	instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn
<span id="L1920" class="ln">  1920</span>	friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a
<span id="L1921" class="ln">  1921</span>	pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.
<span id="L1922" class="ln">  1922</span>	The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were
<span id="L1923" class="ln">  1923</span>	interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of
<span id="L1924" class="ln">  1924</span>	the tick. So he put Joe&#39;s slate on the desk and drew a line down the
<span id="L1925" class="ln">  1925</span>	middle of it from top to bottom.
<span id="L1926" class="ln">  1926</span>	
<span id="L1927" class="ln">  1927</span>	&#34;Now,&#34; said he, &#34;as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
<span id="L1928" class="ln">  1928</span>	I&#39;ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,
<span id="L1929" class="ln">  1929</span>	you&#39;re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.&#34;
<span id="L1930" class="ln">  1930</span>	
<span id="L1931" class="ln">  1931</span>	&#34;All right, go ahead; start him up.&#34;
<span id="L1932" class="ln">  1932</span>	
<span id="L1933" class="ln">  1933</span>	The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe
<span id="L1934" class="ln">  1934</span>	harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This
<span id="L1935" class="ln">  1935</span>	change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with
<span id="L1936" class="ln">  1936</span>	absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong,
<span id="L1937" class="ln">  1937</span>	the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to
<span id="L1938" class="ln">  1938</span>	all things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The
<span id="L1939" class="ln">  1939</span>	tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as
<span id="L1940" class="ln">  1940</span>	anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would
<span id="L1941" class="ln">  1941</span>	have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom&#39;s fingers would be
<span id="L1942" class="ln">  1942</span>	twitching to begin, Joe&#39;s pin would deftly head him off, and keep
<span id="L1943" class="ln">  1943</span>	possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was
<span id="L1944" class="ln">  1944</span>	too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was
<span id="L1945" class="ln">  1945</span>	angry in a moment. Said he:
<span id="L1946" class="ln">  1946</span>	
<span id="L1947" class="ln">  1947</span>	&#34;Tom, you let him alone.&#34;
<span id="L1948" class="ln">  1948</span>	
<span id="L1949" class="ln">  1949</span>	&#34;I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.&#34;
<span id="L1950" class="ln">  1950</span>	
<span id="L1951" class="ln">  1951</span>	&#34;No, sir, it ain&#39;t fair; you just let him alone.&#34;
<span id="L1952" class="ln">  1952</span>	
<span id="L1953" class="ln">  1953</span>	&#34;Blame it, I ain&#39;t going to stir him much.&#34;
<span id="L1954" class="ln">  1954</span>	
<span id="L1955" class="ln">  1955</span>	&#34;Let him alone, I tell you.&#34;
<span id="L1956" class="ln">  1956</span>	
<span id="L1957" class="ln">  1957</span>	&#34;I won&#39;t!&#34;
<span id="L1958" class="ln">  1958</span>	
<span id="L1959" class="ln">  1959</span>	&#34;You shall--he&#39;s on my side of the line.&#34;
<span id="L1960" class="ln">  1960</span>	
<span id="L1961" class="ln">  1961</span>	&#34;Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?&#34;
<span id="L1962" class="ln">  1962</span>	
<span id="L1963" class="ln">  1963</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t care whose tick he is--he&#39;s on my side of the line, and you
<span id="L1964" class="ln">  1964</span>	sha&#39;n&#39;t touch him.&#34;
<span id="L1965" class="ln">  1965</span>	
<span id="L1966" class="ln">  1966</span>	&#34;Well, I&#39;ll just bet I will, though. He&#39;s my tick and I&#39;ll do what I
<span id="L1967" class="ln">  1967</span>	blame please with him, or die!&#34;
<span id="L1968" class="ln">  1968</span>	
<span id="L1969" class="ln">  1969</span>	A tremendous whack came down on Tom&#39;s shoulders, and its duplicate on
<span id="L1970" class="ln">  1970</span>	Joe&#39;s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
<span id="L1971" class="ln">  1971</span>	the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too
<span id="L1972" class="ln">  1972</span>	absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
<span id="L1973" class="ln">  1973</span>	before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over
<span id="L1974" class="ln">  1974</span>	them. He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he
<span id="L1975" class="ln">  1975</span>	contributed his bit of variety to it.
<span id="L1976" class="ln">  1976</span>	
<span id="L1977" class="ln">  1977</span>	When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and
<span id="L1978" class="ln">  1978</span>	whispered in her ear:
<span id="L1979" class="ln">  1979</span>	
<span id="L1980" class="ln">  1980</span>	&#34;Put on your bonnet and let on you&#39;re going home; and when you get to
<span id="L1981" class="ln">  1981</span>	the corner, give the rest of &#39;em the slip, and turn down through the
<span id="L1982" class="ln">  1982</span>	lane and come back. I&#39;ll go the other way and come it over &#39;em the same
<span id="L1983" class="ln">  1983</span>	way.&#34;
<span id="L1984" class="ln">  1984</span>	
<span id="L1985" class="ln">  1985</span>	So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with
<span id="L1986" class="ln">  1986</span>	another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and
<span id="L1987" class="ln">  1987</span>	when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they
<span id="L1988" class="ln">  1988</span>	sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil
<span id="L1989" class="ln">  1989</span>	and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising
<span id="L1990" class="ln">  1990</span>	house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.
<span id="L1991" class="ln">  1991</span>	Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:
<span id="L1992" class="ln">  1992</span>	
<span id="L1993" class="ln">  1993</span>	&#34;Do you love rats?&#34;
<span id="L1994" class="ln">  1994</span>	
<span id="L1995" class="ln">  1995</span>	&#34;No! I hate them!&#34;
<span id="L1996" class="ln">  1996</span>	
<span id="L1997" class="ln">  1997</span>	&#34;Well, I do, too--LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your
<span id="L1998" class="ln">  1998</span>	head with a string.&#34;
<span id="L1999" class="ln">  1999</span>	
<span id="L2000" class="ln">  2000</span>	&#34;No, I don&#39;t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.&#34;
<span id="L2001" class="ln">  2001</span>	
<span id="L2002" class="ln">  2002</span>	&#34;Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.&#34;
<span id="L2003" class="ln">  2003</span>	
<span id="L2004" class="ln">  2004</span>	&#34;Do you? I&#39;ve got some. I&#39;ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give
<span id="L2005" class="ln">  2005</span>	it back to me.&#34;
<span id="L2006" class="ln">  2006</span>	
<span id="L2007" class="ln">  2007</span>	That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their
<span id="L2008" class="ln">  2008</span>	legs against the bench in excess of contentment.
<span id="L2009" class="ln">  2009</span>	
<span id="L2010" class="ln">  2010</span>	&#34;Was you ever at a circus?&#34; said Tom.
<span id="L2011" class="ln">  2011</span>	
<span id="L2012" class="ln">  2012</span>	&#34;Yes, and my pa&#39;s going to take me again some time, if I&#39;m good.&#34;
<span id="L2013" class="ln">  2013</span>	
<span id="L2014" class="ln">  2014</span>	&#34;I been to the circus three or four times--lots of times. Church ain&#39;t
<span id="L2015" class="ln">  2015</span>	shucks to a circus. There&#39;s things going on at a circus all the time.
<span id="L2016" class="ln">  2016</span>	I&#39;m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.&#34;
<span id="L2017" class="ln">  2017</span>	
<span id="L2018" class="ln">  2018</span>	&#34;Oh, are you! That will be nice. They&#39;re so lovely, all spotted up.&#34;
<span id="L2019" class="ln">  2019</span>	
<span id="L2020" class="ln">  2020</span>	&#34;Yes, that&#39;s so. And they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day,
<span id="L2021" class="ln">  2021</span>	Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?&#34;
<span id="L2022" class="ln">  2022</span>	
<span id="L2023" class="ln">  2023</span>	&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;
<span id="L2024" class="ln">  2024</span>	
<span id="L2025" class="ln">  2025</span>	&#34;Why, engaged to be married.&#34;
<span id="L2026" class="ln">  2026</span>	
<span id="L2027" class="ln">  2027</span>	&#34;No.&#34;
<span id="L2028" class="ln">  2028</span>	
<span id="L2029" class="ln">  2029</span>	&#34;Would you like to?&#34;
<span id="L2030" class="ln">  2030</span>	
<span id="L2031" class="ln">  2031</span>	&#34;I reckon so. I don&#39;t know. What is it like?&#34;
<span id="L2032" class="ln">  2032</span>	
<span id="L2033" class="ln">  2033</span>	&#34;Like? Why it ain&#39;t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won&#39;t
<span id="L2034" class="ln">  2034</span>	ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that&#39;s
<span id="L2035" class="ln">  2035</span>	all. Anybody can do it.&#34;
<span id="L2036" class="ln">  2036</span>	
<span id="L2037" class="ln">  2037</span>	&#34;Kiss? What do you kiss for?&#34;
<span id="L2038" class="ln">  2038</span>	
<span id="L2039" class="ln">  2039</span>	&#34;Why, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.&#34;
<span id="L2040" class="ln">  2040</span>	
<span id="L2041" class="ln">  2041</span>	&#34;Everybody?&#34;
<span id="L2042" class="ln">  2042</span>	
<span id="L2043" class="ln">  2043</span>	&#34;Why, yes, everybody that&#39;s in love with each other. Do you remember
<span id="L2044" class="ln">  2044</span>	what I wrote on the slate?&#34;
<span id="L2045" class="ln">  2045</span>	
<span id="L2046" class="ln">  2046</span>	&#34;Ye--yes.&#34;
<span id="L2047" class="ln">  2047</span>	
<span id="L2048" class="ln">  2048</span>	&#34;What was it?&#34;
<span id="L2049" class="ln">  2049</span>	
<span id="L2050" class="ln">  2050</span>	&#34;I sha&#39;n&#39;t tell you.&#34;
<span id="L2051" class="ln">  2051</span>	
<span id="L2052" class="ln">  2052</span>	&#34;Shall I tell YOU?&#34;
<span id="L2053" class="ln">  2053</span>	
<span id="L2054" class="ln">  2054</span>	&#34;Ye--yes--but some other time.&#34;
<span id="L2055" class="ln">  2055</span>	
<span id="L2056" class="ln">  2056</span>	&#34;No, now.&#34;
<span id="L2057" class="ln">  2057</span>	
<span id="L2058" class="ln">  2058</span>	&#34;No, not now--to-morrow.&#34;
<span id="L2059" class="ln">  2059</span>	
<span id="L2060" class="ln">  2060</span>	&#34;Oh, no, NOW. Please, Becky--I&#39;ll whisper it, I&#39;ll whisper it ever so
<span id="L2061" class="ln">  2061</span>	easy.&#34;
<span id="L2062" class="ln">  2062</span>	
<span id="L2063" class="ln">  2063</span>	Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm
<span id="L2064" class="ln">  2064</span>	about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth
<span id="L2065" class="ln">  2065</span>	close to her ear. And then he added:
<span id="L2066" class="ln">  2066</span>	
<span id="L2067" class="ln">  2067</span>	&#34;Now you whisper it to me--just the same.&#34;
<span id="L2068" class="ln">  2068</span>	
<span id="L2069" class="ln">  2069</span>	She resisted, for a while, and then said:
<span id="L2070" class="ln">  2070</span>	
<span id="L2071" class="ln">  2071</span>	&#34;You turn your face away so you can&#39;t see, and then I will. But you
<span id="L2072" class="ln">  2072</span>	mustn&#39;t ever tell anybody--WILL you, Tom? Now you won&#39;t, WILL you?&#34;
<span id="L2073" class="ln">  2073</span>	
<span id="L2074" class="ln">  2074</span>	&#34;No, indeed, indeed I won&#39;t. Now, Becky.&#34;
<span id="L2075" class="ln">  2075</span>	
<span id="L2076" class="ln">  2076</span>	He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath
<span id="L2077" class="ln">  2077</span>	stirred his curls and whispered, &#34;I--love--you!&#34;
<span id="L2078" class="ln">  2078</span>	
<span id="L2079" class="ln">  2079</span>	Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,
<span id="L2080" class="ln">  2080</span>	with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her
<span id="L2081" class="ln">  2081</span>	little white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and
<span id="L2082" class="ln">  2082</span>	pleaded:
<span id="L2083" class="ln">  2083</span>	
<span id="L2084" class="ln">  2084</span>	&#34;Now, Becky, it&#39;s all done--all over but the kiss. Don&#39;t you be afraid
<span id="L2085" class="ln">  2085</span>	of that--it ain&#39;t anything at all. Please, Becky.&#34; And he tugged at her
<span id="L2086" class="ln">  2086</span>	apron and the hands.
<span id="L2087" class="ln">  2087</span>	
<span id="L2088" class="ln">  2088</span>	By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing
<span id="L2089" class="ln">  2089</span>	with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and
<span id="L2090" class="ln">  2090</span>	said:
<span id="L2091" class="ln">  2091</span>	
<span id="L2092" class="ln">  2092</span>	&#34;Now it&#39;s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain&#39;t
<span id="L2093" class="ln">  2093</span>	ever to love anybody but me, and you ain&#39;t ever to marry anybody but
<span id="L2094" class="ln">  2094</span>	me, ever never and forever. Will you?&#34;
<span id="L2095" class="ln">  2095</span>	
<span id="L2096" class="ln">  2096</span>	&#34;No, I&#39;ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I&#39;ll never marry
<span id="L2097" class="ln">  2097</span>	anybody but you--and you ain&#39;t to ever marry anybody but me, either.&#34;
<span id="L2098" class="ln">  2098</span>	
<span id="L2099" class="ln">  2099</span>	&#34;Certainly. Of course. That&#39;s PART of it. And always coming to school
<span id="L2100" class="ln">  2100</span>	or when we&#39;re going home, you&#39;re to walk with me, when there ain&#39;t
<span id="L2101" class="ln">  2101</span>	anybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because
<span id="L2102" class="ln">  2102</span>	that&#39;s the way you do when you&#39;re engaged.&#34;
<span id="L2103" class="ln">  2103</span>	
<span id="L2104" class="ln">  2104</span>	&#34;It&#39;s so nice. I never heard of it before.&#34;
<span id="L2105" class="ln">  2105</span>	
<span id="L2106" class="ln">  2106</span>	&#34;Oh, it&#39;s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--&#34;
<span id="L2107" class="ln">  2107</span>	
<span id="L2108" class="ln">  2108</span>	The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.
<span id="L2109" class="ln">  2109</span>	
<span id="L2110" class="ln">  2110</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom! Then I ain&#39;t the first you&#39;ve ever been engaged to!&#34;
<span id="L2111" class="ln">  2111</span>	
<span id="L2112" class="ln">  2112</span>	The child began to cry. Tom said:
<span id="L2113" class="ln">  2113</span>	
<span id="L2114" class="ln">  2114</span>	&#34;Oh, don&#39;t cry, Becky, I don&#39;t care for her any more.&#34;
<span id="L2115" class="ln">  2115</span>	
<span id="L2116" class="ln">  2116</span>	&#34;Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.&#34;
<span id="L2117" class="ln">  2117</span>	
<span id="L2118" class="ln">  2118</span>	Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
<span id="L2119" class="ln">  2119</span>	turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with
<span id="L2120" class="ln">  2120</span>	soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was
<span id="L2121" class="ln">  2121</span>	up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and
<span id="L2122" class="ln">  2122</span>	uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
<span id="L2123" class="ln">  2123</span>	she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began
<span id="L2124" class="ln">  2124</span>	to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle
<span id="L2125" class="ln">  2125</span>	with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and
<span id="L2126" class="ln">  2126</span>	entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
<span id="L2127" class="ln">  2127</span>	her face to the wall. Tom&#39;s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
<span id="L2128" class="ln">  2128</span>	moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:
<span id="L2129" class="ln">  2129</span>	
<span id="L2130" class="ln">  2130</span>	&#34;Becky, I--I don&#39;t care for anybody but you.&#34;
<span id="L2131" class="ln">  2131</span>	
<span id="L2132" class="ln">  2132</span>	No reply--but sobs.
<span id="L2133" class="ln">  2133</span>	
<span id="L2134" class="ln">  2134</span>	&#34;Becky&#34;--pleadingly. &#34;Becky, won&#39;t you say something?&#34;
<span id="L2135" class="ln">  2135</span>	
<span id="L2136" class="ln">  2136</span>	More sobs.
<span id="L2137" class="ln">  2137</span>	
<span id="L2138" class="ln">  2138</span>	Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an
<span id="L2139" class="ln">  2139</span>	andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:
<span id="L2140" class="ln">  2140</span>	
<span id="L2141" class="ln">  2141</span>	&#34;Please, Becky, won&#39;t you take it?&#34;
<span id="L2142" class="ln">  2142</span>	
<span id="L2143" class="ln">  2143</span>	She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over
<span id="L2144" class="ln">  2144</span>	the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently
<span id="L2145" class="ln">  2145</span>	Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she
<span id="L2146" class="ln">  2146</span>	flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:
<span id="L2147" class="ln">  2147</span>	
<span id="L2148" class="ln">  2148</span>	&#34;Tom! Come back, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L2149" class="ln">  2149</span>	
<span id="L2150" class="ln">  2150</span>	She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions
<span id="L2151" class="ln">  2151</span>	but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid
<span id="L2152" class="ln">  2152</span>	herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she
<span id="L2153" class="ln">  2153</span>	had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
<span id="L2154" class="ln">  2154</span>	of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers
<span id="L2155" class="ln">  2155</span>	about her to exchange sorrows with.
<span id="L2156" class="ln">  2156</span>	
<span id="L2157" class="ln">  2157</span>	
<span id="L2158" class="ln">  2158</span>	
<span id="L2159" class="ln">  2159</span>	CHAPTER VIII
<span id="L2160" class="ln">  2160</span>	
<span id="L2161" class="ln">  2161</span>	TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of
<span id="L2162" class="ln">  2162</span>	the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He
<span id="L2163" class="ln">  2163</span>	crossed a small &#34;branch&#34; two or three times, because of a prevailing
<span id="L2164" class="ln">  2164</span>	juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour
<span id="L2165" class="ln">  2165</span>	later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of
<span id="L2166" class="ln">  2166</span>	Cardiff Hill, and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off
<span id="L2167" class="ln">  2167</span>	in the valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless
<span id="L2168" class="ln">  2168</span>	way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading
<span id="L2169" class="ln">  2169</span>	oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had
<span id="L2170" class="ln">  2170</span>	even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was
<span id="L2171" class="ln">  2171</span>	broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a
<span id="L2172" class="ln">  2172</span>	woodpecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense
<span id="L2173" class="ln">  2173</span>	of loneliness the more profound. The boy&#39;s soul was steeped in
<span id="L2174" class="ln">  2174</span>	melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He
<span id="L2175" class="ln">  2175</span>	sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands,
<span id="L2176" class="ln">  2176</span>	meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and
<span id="L2177" class="ln">  2177</span>	he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be
<span id="L2178" class="ln">  2178</span>	very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and
<span id="L2179" class="ln">  2179</span>	ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the
<span id="L2180" class="ln">  2180</span>	grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve
<span id="L2181" class="ln">  2181</span>	about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he
<span id="L2182" class="ln">  2182</span>	could be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl.
<span id="L2183" class="ln">  2183</span>	What had he done? Nothing. He had meant the best in the world, and been
<span id="L2184" class="ln">  2184</span>	treated like a dog--like a very dog. She would be sorry some day--maybe
<span id="L2185" class="ln">  2185</span>	when it was too late. Ah, if he could only die TEMPORARILY!
<span id="L2186" class="ln">  2186</span>	
<span id="L2187" class="ln">  2187</span>	But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one
<span id="L2188" class="ln">  2188</span>	constrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift
<span id="L2189" class="ln">  2189</span>	insensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he turned
<span id="L2190" class="ln">  2190</span>	his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever
<span id="L2191" class="ln">  2191</span>	so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came
<span id="L2192" class="ln">  2192</span>	back any more! How would she feel then! The idea of being a clown
<span id="L2193" class="ln">  2193</span>	recurred to him now, only to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and
<span id="L2194" class="ln">  2194</span>	jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded themselves
<span id="L2195" class="ln">  2195</span>	upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the
<span id="L2196" class="ln">  2196</span>	romantic. No, he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all
<span id="L2197" class="ln">  2197</span>	war-worn and illustrious. No--better still, he would join the Indians,
<span id="L2198" class="ln">  2198</span>	and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the
<span id="L2199" class="ln">  2199</span>	trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come
<span id="L2200" class="ln">  2200</span>	back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and
<span id="L2201" class="ln">  2201</span>	prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a
<span id="L2202" class="ln">  2202</span>	bloodcurdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions
<span id="L2203" class="ln">  2203</span>	with unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even than
<span id="L2204" class="ln">  2204</span>	this. He would be a pirate! That was it! NOW his future lay plain
<span id="L2205" class="ln">  2205</span>	before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name would
<span id="L2206" class="ln">  2206</span>	fill the world, and make people shudder! How gloriously he would go
<span id="L2207" class="ln">  2207</span>	plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the
<span id="L2208" class="ln">  2208</span>	Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore! And at
<span id="L2209" class="ln">  2209</span>	the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village
<span id="L2210" class="ln">  2210</span>	and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet
<span id="L2211" class="ln">  2211</span>	doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt
<span id="L2212" class="ln">  2212</span>	bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his
<span id="L2213" class="ln">  2213</span>	slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull
<span id="L2214" class="ln">  2214</span>	and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings,
<span id="L2215" class="ln">  2215</span>	&#34;It&#39;s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!&#34;
<span id="L2216" class="ln">  2216</span>	
<span id="L2217" class="ln">  2217</span>	Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from
<span id="L2218" class="ln">  2218</span>	home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore
<span id="L2219" class="ln">  2219</span>	he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources
<span id="L2220" class="ln">  2220</span>	together. He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under
<span id="L2221" class="ln">  2221</span>	one end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded
<span id="L2222" class="ln">  2222</span>	hollow. He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:
<span id="L2223" class="ln">  2223</span>	
<span id="L2224" class="ln">  2224</span>	&#34;What hasn&#39;t come here, come! What&#39;s here, stay here!&#34;
<span id="L2225" class="ln">  2225</span>	
<span id="L2226" class="ln">  2226</span>	Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it
<span id="L2227" class="ln">  2227</span>	up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
<span id="L2228" class="ln">  2228</span>	were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom&#39;s astonishment was boundless!
<span id="L2229" class="ln">  2229</span>	He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:
<span id="L2230" class="ln">  2230</span>	
<span id="L2231" class="ln">  2231</span>	&#34;Well, that beats anything!&#34;
<span id="L2232" class="ln">  2232</span>	
<span id="L2233" class="ln">  2233</span>	Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The
<span id="L2234" class="ln">  2234</span>	truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and
<span id="L2235" class="ln">  2235</span>	all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a
<span id="L2236" class="ln">  2236</span>	marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
<span id="L2237" class="ln">  2237</span>	fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
<span id="L2238" class="ln">  2238</span>	used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had
<span id="L2239" class="ln">  2239</span>	gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they
<span id="L2240" class="ln">  2240</span>	had been separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably
<span id="L2241" class="ln">  2241</span>	failed. Tom&#39;s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.
<span id="L2242" class="ln">  2242</span>	He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its
<span id="L2243" class="ln">  2243</span>	failing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several
<span id="L2244" class="ln">  2244</span>	times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places
<span id="L2245" class="ln">  2245</span>	afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided
<span id="L2246" class="ln">  2246</span>	that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he
<span id="L2247" class="ln">  2247</span>	would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he
<span id="L2248" class="ln">  2248</span>	found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it.
<span id="L2249" class="ln">  2249</span>	He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and
<span id="L2250" class="ln">  2250</span>	called--
<span id="L2251" class="ln">  2251</span>	
<span id="L2252" class="ln">  2252</span>	&#34;Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
<span id="L2253" class="ln">  2253</span>	doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!&#34;
<span id="L2254" class="ln">  2254</span>	
<span id="L2255" class="ln">  2255</span>	The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
<span id="L2256" class="ln">  2256</span>	second and then darted under again in a fright.
<span id="L2257" class="ln">  2257</span>	
<span id="L2258" class="ln">  2258</span>	&#34;He dasn&#39;t tell! So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed it.&#34;
<span id="L2259" class="ln">  2259</span>	
<span id="L2260" class="ln">  2260</span>	He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
<span id="L2261" class="ln">  2261</span>	gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have
<span id="L2262" class="ln">  2262</span>	the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a
<span id="L2263" class="ln">  2263</span>	patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to
<span id="L2264" class="ln">  2264</span>	his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been
<span id="L2265" class="ln">  2265</span>	standing when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble
<span id="L2266" class="ln">  2266</span>	from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:
<span id="L2267" class="ln">  2267</span>	
<span id="L2268" class="ln">  2268</span>	&#34;Brother, go find your brother!&#34;
<span id="L2269" class="ln">  2269</span>	
<span id="L2270" class="ln">  2270</span>	He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must
<span id="L2271" class="ln">  2271</span>	have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last
<span id="L2272" class="ln">  2272</span>	repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each
<span id="L2273" class="ln">  2273</span>	other.
<span id="L2274" class="ln">  2274</span>	
<span id="L2275" class="ln">  2275</span>	Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
<span id="L2276" class="ln">  2276</span>	aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a
<span id="L2277" class="ln">  2277</span>	suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
<span id="L2278" class="ln">  2278</span>	disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in
<span id="L2279" class="ln">  2279</span>	a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with
<span id="L2280" class="ln">  2280</span>	fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an
<span id="L2281" class="ln">  2281</span>	answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
<span id="L2282" class="ln">  2282</span>	and that. He said cautiously--to an imaginary company:
<span id="L2283" class="ln">  2283</span>	
<span id="L2284" class="ln">  2284</span>	&#34;Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.&#34;
<span id="L2285" class="ln">  2285</span>	
<span id="L2286" class="ln">  2286</span>	Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.
<span id="L2287" class="ln">  2287</span>	Tom called:
<span id="L2288" class="ln">  2288</span>	
<span id="L2289" class="ln">  2289</span>	&#34;Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?&#34;
<span id="L2290" class="ln">  2290</span>	
<span id="L2291" class="ln">  2291</span>	&#34;Guy of Guisborne wants no man&#39;s pass. Who art thou that--that--&#34;
<span id="L2292" class="ln">  2292</span>	
<span id="L2293" class="ln">  2293</span>	&#34;Dares to hold such language,&#34; said Tom, prompting--for they talked
<span id="L2294" class="ln">  2294</span>	&#34;by the book,&#34; from memory.
<span id="L2295" class="ln">  2295</span>	
<span id="L2296" class="ln">  2296</span>	&#34;Who art thou that dares to hold such language?&#34;
<span id="L2297" class="ln">  2297</span>	
<span id="L2298" class="ln">  2298</span>	&#34;I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.&#34;
<span id="L2299" class="ln">  2299</span>	
<span id="L2300" class="ln">  2300</span>	&#34;Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute
<span id="L2301" class="ln">  2301</span>	with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!&#34;
<span id="L2302" class="ln">  2302</span>	
<span id="L2303" class="ln">  2303</span>	They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
<span id="L2304" class="ln">  2304</span>	struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful
<span id="L2305" class="ln">  2305</span>	combat, &#34;two up and two down.&#34; Presently Tom said:
<span id="L2306" class="ln">  2306</span>	
<span id="L2307" class="ln">  2307</span>	&#34;Now, if you&#39;ve got the hang, go it lively!&#34;
<span id="L2308" class="ln">  2308</span>	
<span id="L2309" class="ln">  2309</span>	So they &#34;went it lively,&#34; panting and perspiring with the work. By and
<span id="L2310" class="ln">  2310</span>	by Tom shouted:
<span id="L2311" class="ln">  2311</span>	
<span id="L2312" class="ln">  2312</span>	&#34;Fall! fall! Why don&#39;t you fall?&#34;
<span id="L2313" class="ln">  2313</span>	
<span id="L2314" class="ln">  2314</span>	&#34;I sha&#39;n&#39;t! Why don&#39;t you fall yourself? You&#39;re getting the worst of
<span id="L2315" class="ln">  2315</span>	it.&#34;
<span id="L2316" class="ln">  2316</span>	
<span id="L2317" class="ln">  2317</span>	&#34;Why, that ain&#39;t anything. I can&#39;t fall; that ain&#39;t the way it is in
<span id="L2318" class="ln">  2318</span>	the book. The book says, &#39;Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor
<span id="L2319" class="ln">  2319</span>	Guy of Guisborne.&#39; You&#39;re to turn around and let me hit you in the
<span id="L2320" class="ln">  2320</span>	back.&#34;
<span id="L2321" class="ln">  2321</span>	
<span id="L2322" class="ln">  2322</span>	There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received
<span id="L2323" class="ln">  2323</span>	the whack and fell.
<span id="L2324" class="ln">  2324</span>	
<span id="L2325" class="ln">  2325</span>	&#34;Now,&#34; said Joe, getting up, &#34;you got to let me kill YOU. That&#39;s fair.&#34;
<span id="L2326" class="ln">  2326</span>	
<span id="L2327" class="ln">  2327</span>	&#34;Why, I can&#39;t do that, it ain&#39;t in the book.&#34;
<span id="L2328" class="ln">  2328</span>	
<span id="L2329" class="ln">  2329</span>	&#34;Well, it&#39;s blamed mean--that&#39;s all.&#34;
<span id="L2330" class="ln">  2330</span>	
<span id="L2331" class="ln">  2331</span>	&#34;Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller&#39;s son, and
<span id="L2332" class="ln">  2332</span>	lam me with a quarter-staff; or I&#39;ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and
<span id="L2333" class="ln">  2333</span>	you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.&#34;
<span id="L2334" class="ln">  2334</span>	
<span id="L2335" class="ln">  2335</span>	This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then
<span id="L2336" class="ln">  2336</span>	Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
<span id="L2337" class="ln">  2337</span>	bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,
<span id="L2338" class="ln">  2338</span>	representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,
<span id="L2339" class="ln">  2339</span>	gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, &#34;Where this arrow
<span id="L2340" class="ln">  2340</span>	falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.&#34; Then he
<span id="L2341" class="ln">  2341</span>	shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a
<span id="L2342" class="ln">  2342</span>	nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.
<span id="L2343" class="ln">  2343</span>	
<span id="L2344" class="ln">  2344</span>	The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
<span id="L2345" class="ln">  2345</span>	grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
<span id="L2346" class="ln">  2346</span>	civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
<span id="L2347" class="ln">  2347</span>	They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than
<span id="L2348" class="ln">  2348</span>	President of the United States forever.
<span id="L2349" class="ln">  2349</span>	
<span id="L2350" class="ln">  2350</span>	
<span id="L2351" class="ln">  2351</span>	
<span id="L2352" class="ln">  2352</span>	CHAPTER IX
<span id="L2353" class="ln">  2353</span>	
<span id="L2354" class="ln">  2354</span>	AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.
<span id="L2355" class="ln">  2355</span>	They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and
<span id="L2356" class="ln">  2356</span>	waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be
<span id="L2357" class="ln">  2357</span>	nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He
<span id="L2358" class="ln">  2358</span>	would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
<span id="L2359" class="ln">  2359</span>	afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
<span id="L2360" class="ln">  2360</span>	Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,
<span id="L2361" class="ln">  2361</span>	scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking
<span id="L2362" class="ln">  2362</span>	of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to
<span id="L2363" class="ln">  2363</span>	crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were
<span id="L2364" class="ln">  2364</span>	abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly&#39;s chamber. And
<span id="L2365" class="ln">  2365</span>	now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could
<span id="L2366" class="ln">  2366</span>	locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at
<span id="L2367" class="ln">  2367</span>	the bed&#39;s head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody&#39;s days were
<span id="L2368" class="ln">  2368</span>	numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was
<span id="L2369" class="ln">  2369</span>	answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an
<span id="L2370" class="ln">  2370</span>	agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity
<span id="L2371" class="ln">  2371</span>	begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven,
<span id="L2372" class="ln">  2372</span>	but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his
<span id="L2373" class="ln">  2373</span>	half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a
<span id="L2374" class="ln">  2374</span>	neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of &#34;Scat! you devil!&#34; and the
<span id="L2375" class="ln">  2375</span>	crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt&#39;s woodshed
<span id="L2376" class="ln">  2376</span>	brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and
<span id="L2377" class="ln">  2377</span>	out of the window and creeping along the roof of the &#34;ell&#34; on all
<span id="L2378" class="ln">  2378</span>	fours. He &#34;meow&#39;d&#34; with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped
<span id="L2379" class="ln">  2379</span>	to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn
<span id="L2380" class="ln">  2380</span>	was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the
<span id="L2381" class="ln">  2381</span>	gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall
<span id="L2382" class="ln">  2382</span>	grass of the graveyard.
<span id="L2383" class="ln">  2383</span>	
<span id="L2384" class="ln">  2384</span>	It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a
<span id="L2385" class="ln">  2385</span>	hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board
<span id="L2386" class="ln">  2386</span>	fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of
<span id="L2387" class="ln">  2387</span>	the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the
<span id="L2388" class="ln">  2388</span>	whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a
<span id="L2389" class="ln">  2389</span>	tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over
<span id="L2390" class="ln">  2390</span>	the graves, leaning for support and finding none. &#34;Sacred to the memory
<span id="L2391" class="ln">  2391</span>	of&#34; So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer
<span id="L2392" class="ln">  2392</span>	have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.
<span id="L2393" class="ln">  2393</span>	
<span id="L2394" class="ln">  2394</span>	A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
<span id="L2395" class="ln">  2395</span>	spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked
<span id="L2396" class="ln">  2396</span>	little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the
<span id="L2397" class="ln">  2397</span>	pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the
<span id="L2398" class="ln">  2398</span>	sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
<span id="L2399" class="ln">  2399</span>	protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet
<span id="L2400" class="ln">  2400</span>	of the grave.
<span id="L2401" class="ln">  2401</span>	
<span id="L2402" class="ln">  2402</span>	Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting
<span id="L2403" class="ln">  2403</span>	of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness.
<span id="L2404" class="ln">  2404</span>	Tom&#39;s reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said
<span id="L2405" class="ln">  2405</span>	in a whisper:
<span id="L2406" class="ln">  2406</span>	
<span id="L2407" class="ln">  2407</span>	&#34;Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?&#34;
<span id="L2408" class="ln">  2408</span>	
<span id="L2409" class="ln">  2409</span>	Huckleberry whispered:
<span id="L2410" class="ln">  2410</span>	
<span id="L2411" class="ln">  2411</span>	&#34;I wisht I knowed. It&#39;s awful solemn like, AIN&#39;T it?&#34;
<span id="L2412" class="ln">  2412</span>	
<span id="L2413" class="ln">  2413</span>	&#34;I bet it is.&#34;
<span id="L2414" class="ln">  2414</span>	
<span id="L2415" class="ln">  2415</span>	There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
<span id="L2416" class="ln">  2416</span>	inwardly. Then Tom whispered:
<span id="L2417" class="ln">  2417</span>	
<span id="L2418" class="ln">  2418</span>	&#34;Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?&#34;
<span id="L2419" class="ln">  2419</span>	
<span id="L2420" class="ln">  2420</span>	&#34;O&#39; course he does. Least his sperrit does.&#34;
<span id="L2421" class="ln">  2421</span>	
<span id="L2422" class="ln">  2422</span>	Tom, after a pause:
<span id="L2423" class="ln">  2423</span>	
<span id="L2424" class="ln">  2424</span>	&#34;I wish I&#39;d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm.
<span id="L2425" class="ln">  2425</span>	Everybody calls him Hoss.&#34;
<span id="L2426" class="ln">  2426</span>	
<span id="L2427" class="ln">  2427</span>	&#34;A body can&#39;t be too partic&#39;lar how they talk &#39;bout these-yer dead
<span id="L2428" class="ln">  2428</span>	people, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L2429" class="ln">  2429</span>	
<span id="L2430" class="ln">  2430</span>	This was a damper, and conversation died again.
<span id="L2431" class="ln">  2431</span>	
<span id="L2432" class="ln">  2432</span>	Presently Tom seized his comrade&#39;s arm and said:
<span id="L2433" class="ln">  2433</span>	
<span id="L2434" class="ln">  2434</span>	&#34;Sh!&#34;
<span id="L2435" class="ln">  2435</span>	
<span id="L2436" class="ln">  2436</span>	&#34;What is it, Tom?&#34; And the two clung together with beating hearts.
<span id="L2437" class="ln">  2437</span>	
<span id="L2438" class="ln">  2438</span>	&#34;Sh! There &#39;tis again! Didn&#39;t you hear it?&#34;
<span id="L2439" class="ln">  2439</span>	
<span id="L2440" class="ln">  2440</span>	&#34;I--&#34;
<span id="L2441" class="ln">  2441</span>	
<span id="L2442" class="ln">  2442</span>	&#34;There! Now you hear it.&#34;
<span id="L2443" class="ln">  2443</span>	
<span id="L2444" class="ln">  2444</span>	&#34;Lord, Tom, they&#39;re coming! They&#39;re coming, sure. What&#39;ll we do?&#34;
<span id="L2445" class="ln">  2445</span>	
<span id="L2446" class="ln">  2446</span>	&#34;I dono. Think they&#39;ll see us?&#34;
<span id="L2447" class="ln">  2447</span>	
<span id="L2448" class="ln">  2448</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn&#39;t
<span id="L2449" class="ln">  2449</span>	come.&#34;
<span id="L2450" class="ln">  2450</span>	
<span id="L2451" class="ln">  2451</span>	&#34;Oh, don&#39;t be afeard. I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ll bother us. We ain&#39;t
<span id="L2452" class="ln">  2452</span>	doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won&#39;t notice us
<span id="L2453" class="ln">  2453</span>	at all.&#34;
<span id="L2454" class="ln">  2454</span>	
<span id="L2455" class="ln">  2455</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I&#39;m all of a shiver.&#34;
<span id="L2456" class="ln">  2456</span>	
<span id="L2457" class="ln">  2457</span>	&#34;Listen!&#34;
<span id="L2458" class="ln">  2458</span>	
<span id="L2459" class="ln">  2459</span>	The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled
<span id="L2460" class="ln">  2460</span>	sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.
<span id="L2461" class="ln">  2461</span>	
<span id="L2462" class="ln">  2462</span>	&#34;Look! See there!&#34; whispered Tom. &#34;What is it?&#34;
<span id="L2463" class="ln">  2463</span>	
<span id="L2464" class="ln">  2464</span>	&#34;It&#39;s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.&#34;
<span id="L2465" class="ln">  2465</span>	
<span id="L2466" class="ln">  2466</span>	Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
<span id="L2467" class="ln">  2467</span>	old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
<span id="L2468" class="ln">  2468</span>	little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
<span id="L2469" class="ln">  2469</span>	shudder:
<span id="L2470" class="ln">  2470</span>	
<span id="L2471" class="ln">  2471</span>	&#34;It&#39;s the devils sure enough. Three of &#39;em! Lordy, Tom, we&#39;re goners!
<span id="L2472" class="ln">  2472</span>	Can you pray?&#34;
<span id="L2473" class="ln">  2473</span>	
<span id="L2474" class="ln">  2474</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll try, but don&#39;t you be afeard. They ain&#39;t going to hurt us. &#39;Now
<span id="L2475" class="ln">  2475</span>	I lay me down to sleep, I--&#39;&#34;
<span id="L2476" class="ln">  2476</span>	
<span id="L2477" class="ln">  2477</span>	&#34;Sh!&#34;
<span id="L2478" class="ln">  2478</span>	
<span id="L2479" class="ln">  2479</span>	&#34;What is it, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L2480" class="ln">  2480</span>	
<span id="L2481" class="ln">  2481</span>	&#34;They&#39;re HUMANS! One of &#39;em is, anyway. One of &#39;em&#39;s old Muff Potter&#39;s
<span id="L2482" class="ln">  2482</span>	voice.&#34;
<span id="L2483" class="ln">  2483</span>	
<span id="L2484" class="ln">  2484</span>	&#34;No--&#39;tain&#39;t so, is it?&#34;
<span id="L2485" class="ln">  2485</span>	
<span id="L2486" class="ln">  2486</span>	&#34;I bet I know it. Don&#39;t you stir nor budge. He ain&#39;t sharp enough to
<span id="L2487" class="ln">  2487</span>	notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!&#34;
<span id="L2488" class="ln">  2488</span>	
<span id="L2489" class="ln">  2489</span>	&#34;All right, I&#39;ll keep still. Now they&#39;re stuck. Can&#39;t find it. Here
<span id="L2490" class="ln">  2490</span>	they come again. Now they&#39;re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot!
<span id="L2491" class="ln">  2491</span>	They&#39;re p&#39;inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o&#39; them
<span id="L2492" class="ln">  2492</span>	voices; it&#39;s Injun Joe.&#34;
<span id="L2493" class="ln">  2493</span>	
<span id="L2494" class="ln">  2494</span>	&#34;That&#39;s so--that murderin&#39; half-breed! I&#39;d druther they was devils a
<span id="L2495" class="ln">  2495</span>	dern sight. What kin they be up to?&#34;
<span id="L2496" class="ln">  2496</span>	
<span id="L2497" class="ln">  2497</span>	The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the
<span id="L2498" class="ln">  2498</span>	grave and stood within a few feet of the boys&#39; hiding-place.
<span id="L2499" class="ln">  2499</span>	
<span id="L2500" class="ln">  2500</span>	&#34;Here it is,&#34; said the third voice; and the owner of it held the
<span id="L2501" class="ln">  2501</span>	lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.
<span id="L2502" class="ln">  2502</span>	
<span id="L2503" class="ln">  2503</span>	Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a
<span id="L2504" class="ln">  2504</span>	couple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open
<span id="L2505" class="ln">  2505</span>	the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came
<span id="L2506" class="ln">  2506</span>	and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so
<span id="L2507" class="ln">  2507</span>	close the boys could have touched him.
<span id="L2508" class="ln">  2508</span>	
<span id="L2509" class="ln">  2509</span>	&#34;Hurry, men!&#34; he said, in a low voice; &#34;the moon might come out at any
<span id="L2510" class="ln">  2510</span>	moment.&#34;
<span id="L2511" class="ln">  2511</span>	
<span id="L2512" class="ln">  2512</span>	They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was
<span id="L2513" class="ln">  2513</span>	no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight
<span id="L2514" class="ln">  2514</span>	of mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck
<span id="L2515" class="ln">  2515</span>	upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or
<span id="L2516" class="ln">  2516</span>	two the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid
<span id="L2517" class="ln">  2517</span>	with their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the
<span id="L2518" class="ln">  2518</span>	ground. The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid
<span id="L2519" class="ln">  2519</span>	face. The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered
<span id="L2520" class="ln">  2520</span>	with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a
<span id="L2521" class="ln">  2521</span>	large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then
<span id="L2522" class="ln">  2522</span>	said:
<span id="L2523" class="ln">  2523</span>	
<span id="L2524" class="ln">  2524</span>	&#34;Now the cussed thing&#39;s ready, Sawbones, and you&#39;ll just out with
<span id="L2525" class="ln">  2525</span>	another five, or here she stays.&#34;
<span id="L2526" class="ln">  2526</span>	
<span id="L2527" class="ln">  2527</span>	&#34;That&#39;s the talk!&#34; said Injun Joe.
<span id="L2528" class="ln">  2528</span>	
<span id="L2529" class="ln">  2529</span>	&#34;Look here, what does this mean?&#34; said the doctor. &#34;You required your
<span id="L2530" class="ln">  2530</span>	pay in advance, and I&#39;ve paid you.&#34;
<span id="L2531" class="ln">  2531</span>	
<span id="L2532" class="ln">  2532</span>	&#34;Yes, and you done more than that,&#34; said Injun Joe, approaching the
<span id="L2533" class="ln">  2533</span>	doctor, who was now standing. &#34;Five years ago you drove me away from
<span id="L2534" class="ln">  2534</span>	your father&#39;s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to
<span id="L2535" class="ln">  2535</span>	eat, and you said I warn&#39;t there for any good; and when I swore I&#39;d get
<span id="L2536" class="ln">  2536</span>	even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for
<span id="L2537" class="ln">  2537</span>	a vagrant. Did you think I&#39;d forget? The Injun blood ain&#39;t in me for
<span id="L2538" class="ln">  2538</span>	nothing. And now I&#39;ve GOT you, and you got to SETTLE, you know!&#34;
<span id="L2539" class="ln">  2539</span>	
<span id="L2540" class="ln">  2540</span>	He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this
<span id="L2541" class="ln">  2541</span>	time. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the
<span id="L2542" class="ln">  2542</span>	ground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:
<span id="L2543" class="ln">  2543</span>	
<span id="L2544" class="ln">  2544</span>	&#34;Here, now, don&#39;t you hit my pard!&#34; and the next moment he had
<span id="L2545" class="ln">  2545</span>	grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and
<span id="L2546" class="ln">  2546</span>	main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels.
<span id="L2547" class="ln">  2547</span>	Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched
<span id="L2548" class="ln">  2548</span>	up Potter&#39;s knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and
<span id="L2549" class="ln">  2549</span>	round about the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the
<span id="L2550" class="ln">  2550</span>	doctor flung himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams&#39;
<span id="L2551" class="ln">  2551</span>	grave and felled Potter to the earth with it--and in the same instant
<span id="L2552" class="ln">  2552</span>	the half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the
<span id="L2553" class="ln">  2553</span>	young man&#39;s breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him
<span id="L2554" class="ln">  2554</span>	with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the
<span id="L2555" class="ln">  2555</span>	dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in
<span id="L2556" class="ln">  2556</span>	the dark.
<span id="L2557" class="ln">  2557</span>	
<span id="L2558" class="ln">  2558</span>	Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over
<span id="L2559" class="ln">  2559</span>	the two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately,
<span id="L2560" class="ln">  2560</span>	gave a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:
<span id="L2561" class="ln">  2561</span>	
<span id="L2562" class="ln">  2562</span>	&#34;THAT score is settled--damn you.&#34;
<span id="L2563" class="ln">  2563</span>	
<span id="L2564" class="ln">  2564</span>	Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in
<span id="L2565" class="ln">  2565</span>	Potter&#39;s open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three
<span id="L2566" class="ln">  2566</span>	--four--five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His
<span id="L2567" class="ln">  2567</span>	hand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it
<span id="L2568" class="ln">  2568</span>	fall, with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and
<span id="L2569" class="ln">  2569</span>	gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe&#39;s.
<span id="L2570" class="ln">  2570</span>	
<span id="L2571" class="ln">  2571</span>	&#34;Lord, how is this, Joe?&#34; he said.
<span id="L2572" class="ln">  2572</span>	
<span id="L2573" class="ln">  2573</span>	&#34;It&#39;s a dirty business,&#34; said Joe, without moving.
<span id="L2574" class="ln">  2574</span>	
<span id="L2575" class="ln">  2575</span>	&#34;What did you do it for?&#34;
<span id="L2576" class="ln">  2576</span>	
<span id="L2577" class="ln">  2577</span>	&#34;I! I never done it!&#34;
<span id="L2578" class="ln">  2578</span>	
<span id="L2579" class="ln">  2579</span>	&#34;Look here! That kind of talk won&#39;t wash.&#34;
<span id="L2580" class="ln">  2580</span>	
<span id="L2581" class="ln">  2581</span>	Potter trembled and grew white.
<span id="L2582" class="ln">  2582</span>	
<span id="L2583" class="ln">  2583</span>	&#34;I thought I&#39;d got sober. I&#39;d no business to drink to-night. But it&#39;s
<span id="L2584" class="ln">  2584</span>	in my head yet--worse&#39;n when we started here. I&#39;m all in a muddle;
<span id="L2585" class="ln">  2585</span>	can&#39;t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--HONEST, now, old
<span id="L2586" class="ln">  2586</span>	feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--&#39;pon my soul and honor, I
<span id="L2587" class="ln">  2587</span>	never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it&#39;s awful--and him
<span id="L2588" class="ln">  2588</span>	so young and promising.&#34;
<span id="L2589" class="ln">  2589</span>	
<span id="L2590" class="ln">  2590</span>	&#34;Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard
<span id="L2591" class="ln">  2591</span>	and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering
<span id="L2592" class="ln">  2592</span>	like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched
<span id="L2593" class="ln">  2593</span>	you another awful clip--and here you&#39;ve laid, as dead as a wedge til
<span id="L2594" class="ln">  2594</span>	now.&#34;
<span id="L2595" class="ln">  2595</span>	
<span id="L2596" class="ln">  2596</span>	&#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if
<span id="L2597" class="ln">  2597</span>	I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I
<span id="L2598" class="ln">  2598</span>	reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I&#39;ve fought, but
<span id="L2599" class="ln">  2599</span>	never with weepons. They&#39;ll all say that. Joe, don&#39;t tell! Say you
<span id="L2600" class="ln">  2600</span>	won&#39;t tell, Joe--that&#39;s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and
<span id="L2601" class="ln">  2601</span>	stood up for you, too. Don&#39;t you remember? You WON&#39;T tell, WILL you,
<span id="L2602" class="ln">  2602</span>	Joe?&#34; And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid
<span id="L2603" class="ln">  2603</span>	murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.
<span id="L2604" class="ln">  2604</span>	
<span id="L2605" class="ln">  2605</span>	&#34;No, you&#39;ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I
<span id="L2606" class="ln">  2606</span>	won&#39;t go back on you. There, now, that&#39;s as fair as a man can say.&#34;
<span id="L2607" class="ln">  2607</span>	
<span id="L2608" class="ln">  2608</span>	&#34;Oh, Joe, you&#39;re an angel. I&#39;ll bless you for this the longest day I
<span id="L2609" class="ln">  2609</span>	live.&#34; And Potter began to cry.
<span id="L2610" class="ln">  2610</span>	
<span id="L2611" class="ln">  2611</span>	&#34;Come, now, that&#39;s enough of that. This ain&#39;t any time for blubbering.
<span id="L2612" class="ln">  2612</span>	You be off yonder way and I&#39;ll go this. Move, now, and don&#39;t leave any
<span id="L2613" class="ln">  2613</span>	tracks behind you.&#34;
<span id="L2614" class="ln">  2614</span>	
<span id="L2615" class="ln">  2615</span>	Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The
<span id="L2616" class="ln">  2616</span>	half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:
<span id="L2617" class="ln">  2617</span>	
<span id="L2618" class="ln">  2618</span>	&#34;If he&#39;s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
<span id="L2619" class="ln">  2619</span>	had the look of being, he won&#39;t think of the knife till he&#39;s gone so
<span id="L2620" class="ln">  2620</span>	far he&#39;ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself
<span id="L2621" class="ln">  2621</span>	--chicken-heart!&#34;
<span id="L2622" class="ln">  2622</span>	
<span id="L2623" class="ln">  2623</span>	Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the
<span id="L2624" class="ln">  2624</span>	lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the
<span id="L2625" class="ln">  2625</span>	moon&#39;s. The stillness was complete again, too.
<span id="L2626" class="ln">  2626</span>	
<span id="L2627" class="ln">  2627</span>	
<span id="L2628" class="ln">  2628</span>	
<span id="L2629" class="ln">  2629</span>	CHAPTER X
<span id="L2630" class="ln">  2630</span>	
<span id="L2631" class="ln">  2631</span>	THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with
<span id="L2632" class="ln">  2632</span>	horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,
<span id="L2633" class="ln">  2633</span>	apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump
<span id="L2634" class="ln">  2634</span>	that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them
<span id="L2635" class="ln">  2635</span>	catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
<span id="L2636" class="ln">  2636</span>	near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give
<span id="L2637" class="ln">  2637</span>	wings to their feet.
<span id="L2638" class="ln">  2638</span>	
<span id="L2639" class="ln">  2639</span>	&#34;If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!&#34;
<span id="L2640" class="ln">  2640</span>	whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. &#34;I can&#39;t stand it much
<span id="L2641" class="ln">  2641</span>	longer.&#34;
<span id="L2642" class="ln">  2642</span>	
<span id="L2643" class="ln">  2643</span>	Huckleberry&#39;s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed
<span id="L2644" class="ln">  2644</span>	their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.
<span id="L2645" class="ln">  2645</span>	They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst
<span id="L2646" class="ln">  2646</span>	through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
<span id="L2647" class="ln">  2647</span>	shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:
<span id="L2648" class="ln">  2648</span>	
<span id="L2649" class="ln">  2649</span>	&#34;Huckleberry, what do you reckon&#39;ll come of this?&#34;
<span id="L2650" class="ln">  2650</span>	
<span id="L2651" class="ln">  2651</span>	&#34;If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging&#39;ll come of it.&#34;
<span id="L2652" class="ln">  2652</span>	
<span id="L2653" class="ln">  2653</span>	&#34;Do you though?&#34;
<span id="L2654" class="ln">  2654</span>	
<span id="L2655" class="ln">  2655</span>	&#34;Why, I KNOW it, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L2656" class="ln">  2656</span>	
<span id="L2657" class="ln">  2657</span>	Tom thought a while, then he said:
<span id="L2658" class="ln">  2658</span>	
<span id="L2659" class="ln">  2659</span>	&#34;Who&#39;ll tell? We?&#34;
<span id="L2660" class="ln">  2660</span>	
<span id="L2661" class="ln">  2661</span>	&#34;What are you talking about? S&#39;pose something happened and Injun Joe
<span id="L2662" class="ln">  2662</span>	DIDN&#39;T hang? Why, he&#39;d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as
<span id="L2663" class="ln">  2663</span>	we&#39;re a laying here.&#34;
<span id="L2664" class="ln">  2664</span>	
<span id="L2665" class="ln">  2665</span>	&#34;That&#39;s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L2666" class="ln">  2666</span>	
<span id="L2667" class="ln">  2667</span>	&#34;If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he&#39;s fool enough. He&#39;s
<span id="L2668" class="ln">  2668</span>	generally drunk enough.&#34;
<span id="L2669" class="ln">  2669</span>	
<span id="L2670" class="ln">  2670</span>	Tom said nothing--went on thinking. Presently he whispered:
<span id="L2671" class="ln">  2671</span>	
<span id="L2672" class="ln">  2672</span>	&#34;Huck, Muff Potter don&#39;t know it. How can he tell?&#34;
<span id="L2673" class="ln">  2673</span>	
<span id="L2674" class="ln">  2674</span>	&#34;What&#39;s the reason he don&#39;t know it?&#34;
<span id="L2675" class="ln">  2675</span>	
<span id="L2676" class="ln">  2676</span>	&#34;Because he&#39;d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D&#39;you reckon
<span id="L2677" class="ln">  2677</span>	he could see anything? D&#39;you reckon he knowed anything?&#34;
<span id="L2678" class="ln">  2678</span>	
<span id="L2679" class="ln">  2679</span>	&#34;By hokey, that&#39;s so, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L2680" class="ln">  2680</span>	
<span id="L2681" class="ln">  2681</span>	&#34;And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for HIM!&#34;
<span id="L2682" class="ln">  2682</span>	
<span id="L2683" class="ln">  2683</span>	&#34;No, &#39;taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and
<span id="L2684" class="ln">  2684</span>	besides, he always has. Well, when pap&#39;s full, you might take and belt
<span id="L2685" class="ln">  2685</span>	him over the head with a church and you couldn&#39;t phase him. He says so,
<span id="L2686" class="ln">  2686</span>	his own self. So it&#39;s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a
<span id="L2687" class="ln">  2687</span>	man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.&#34;
<span id="L2688" class="ln">  2688</span>	
<span id="L2689" class="ln">  2689</span>	After another reflective silence, Tom said:
<span id="L2690" class="ln">  2690</span>	
<span id="L2691" class="ln">  2691</span>	&#34;Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?&#34;
<span id="L2692" class="ln">  2692</span>	
<span id="L2693" class="ln">  2693</span>	&#34;Tom, we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn&#39;t
<span id="L2694" class="ln">  2694</span>	make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to
<span id="L2695" class="ln">  2695</span>	squeak &#39;bout this and they didn&#39;t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less
<span id="L2696" class="ln">  2696</span>	take and swear to one another--that&#39;s what we got to do--swear to keep
<span id="L2697" class="ln">  2697</span>	mum.&#34;
<span id="L2698" class="ln">  2698</span>	
<span id="L2699" class="ln">  2699</span>	&#34;I&#39;m agreed. It&#39;s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear
<span id="L2700" class="ln">  2700</span>	that we--&#34;
<span id="L2701" class="ln">  2701</span>	
<span id="L2702" class="ln">  2702</span>	&#34;Oh no, that wouldn&#39;t do for this. That&#39;s good enough for little
<span id="L2703" class="ln">  2703</span>	rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz THEY go back on you
<span id="L2704" class="ln">  2704</span>	anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing
<span id="L2705" class="ln">  2705</span>	&#39;bout a big thing like this. And blood.&#34;
<span id="L2706" class="ln">  2706</span>	
<span id="L2707" class="ln">  2707</span>	Tom&#39;s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and
<span id="L2708" class="ln">  2708</span>	awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping
<span id="L2709" class="ln">  2709</span>	with it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight,
<span id="L2710" class="ln">  2710</span>	took a little fragment of &#34;red keel&#34; out of his pocket, got the moon on
<span id="L2711" class="ln">  2711</span>	his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow
<span id="L2712" class="ln">  2712</span>	down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up
<span id="L2713" class="ln">  2713</span>	the pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]
<span id="L2714" class="ln">  2714</span>	
<span id="L2715" class="ln">  2715</span>	   &#34;Huck Finn and
<span id="L2716" class="ln">  2716</span>	    Tom Sawyer swears
<span id="L2717" class="ln">  2717</span>	    they will keep mum
<span id="L2718" class="ln">  2718</span>	    about This and They
<span id="L2719" class="ln">  2719</span>	    wish They may Drop
<span id="L2720" class="ln">  2720</span>	    down dead in Their
<span id="L2721" class="ln">  2721</span>	    Tracks if They ever
<span id="L2722" class="ln">  2722</span>	    Tell and Rot.&#34;
<span id="L2723" class="ln">  2723</span>	
<span id="L2724" class="ln">  2724</span>	Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom&#39;s facility in writing,
<span id="L2725" class="ln">  2725</span>	and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel
<span id="L2726" class="ln">  2726</span>	and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:
<span id="L2727" class="ln">  2727</span>	
<span id="L2728" class="ln">  2728</span>	&#34;Hold on! Don&#39;t do that. A pin&#39;s brass. It might have verdigrease on
<span id="L2729" class="ln">  2729</span>	it.&#34;
<span id="L2730" class="ln">  2730</span>	
<span id="L2731" class="ln">  2731</span>	&#34;What&#39;s verdigrease?&#34;
<span id="L2732" class="ln">  2732</span>	
<span id="L2733" class="ln">  2733</span>	&#34;It&#39;s p&#39;ison. That&#39;s what it is. You just swaller some of it once
<span id="L2734" class="ln">  2734</span>	--you&#39;ll see.&#34;
<span id="L2735" class="ln">  2735</span>	
<span id="L2736" class="ln">  2736</span>	So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy
<span id="L2737" class="ln">  2737</span>	pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In
<span id="L2738" class="ln">  2738</span>	time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the
<span id="L2739" class="ln">  2739</span>	ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to
<span id="L2740" class="ln">  2740</span>	make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle
<span id="L2741" class="ln">  2741</span>	close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and
<span id="L2742" class="ln">  2742</span>	the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and
<span id="L2743" class="ln">  2743</span>	the key thrown away.
<span id="L2744" class="ln">  2744</span>	
<span id="L2745" class="ln">  2745</span>	A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the
<span id="L2746" class="ln">  2746</span>	ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.
<span id="L2747" class="ln">  2747</span>	
<span id="L2748" class="ln">  2748</span>	&#34;Tom,&#34; whispered Huckleberry, &#34;does this keep us from EVER telling
<span id="L2749" class="ln">  2749</span>	--ALWAYS?&#34;
<span id="L2750" class="ln">  2750</span>	
<span id="L2751" class="ln">  2751</span>	&#34;Of course it does. It don&#39;t make any difference WHAT happens, we got
<span id="L2752" class="ln">  2752</span>	to keep mum. We&#39;d drop down dead--don&#39;t YOU know that?&#34;
<span id="L2753" class="ln">  2753</span>	
<span id="L2754" class="ln">  2754</span>	&#34;Yes, I reckon that&#39;s so.&#34;
<span id="L2755" class="ln">  2755</span>	
<span id="L2756" class="ln">  2756</span>	They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up
<span id="L2757" class="ln">  2757</span>	a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. The boys
<span id="L2758" class="ln">  2758</span>	clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.
<span id="L2759" class="ln">  2759</span>	
<span id="L2760" class="ln">  2760</span>	&#34;Which of us does he mean?&#34; gasped Huckleberry.
<span id="L2761" class="ln">  2761</span>	
<span id="L2762" class="ln">  2762</span>	&#34;I dono--peep through the crack. Quick!&#34;
<span id="L2763" class="ln">  2763</span>	
<span id="L2764" class="ln">  2764</span>	&#34;No, YOU, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L2765" class="ln">  2765</span>	
<span id="L2766" class="ln">  2766</span>	&#34;I can&#39;t--I can&#39;t DO it, Huck!&#34;
<span id="L2767" class="ln">  2767</span>	
<span id="L2768" class="ln">  2768</span>	&#34;Please, Tom. There &#39;tis again!&#34;
<span id="L2769" class="ln">  2769</span>	
<span id="L2770" class="ln">  2770</span>	&#34;Oh, lordy, I&#39;m thankful!&#34; whispered Tom. &#34;I know his voice. It&#39;s Bull
<span id="L2771" class="ln">  2771</span>	Harbison.&#34; *
<span id="L2772" class="ln">  2772</span>	
<span id="L2773" class="ln">  2773</span>	[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of
<span id="L2774" class="ln">  2774</span>	him as &#34;Harbison&#39;s Bull,&#34; but a son or a dog of that name was &#34;Bull
<span id="L2775" class="ln">  2775</span>	Harbison.&#34;]
<span id="L2776" class="ln">  2776</span>	
<span id="L2777" class="ln">  2777</span>	&#34;Oh, that&#39;s good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I&#39;d a
<span id="L2778" class="ln">  2778</span>	bet anything it was a STRAY dog.&#34;
<span id="L2779" class="ln">  2779</span>	
<span id="L2780" class="ln">  2780</span>	The dog howled again. The boys&#39; hearts sank once more.
<span id="L2781" class="ln">  2781</span>	
<span id="L2782" class="ln">  2782</span>	&#34;Oh, my! that ain&#39;t no Bull Harbison!&#34; whispered Huckleberry. &#34;DO, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L2783" class="ln">  2783</span>	
<span id="L2784" class="ln">  2784</span>	Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His
<span id="L2785" class="ln">  2785</span>	whisper was hardly audible when he said:
<span id="L2786" class="ln">  2786</span>	
<span id="L2787" class="ln">  2787</span>	&#34;Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!&#34;
<span id="L2788" class="ln">  2788</span>	
<span id="L2789" class="ln">  2789</span>	&#34;Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?&#34;
<span id="L2790" class="ln">  2790</span>	
<span id="L2791" class="ln">  2791</span>	&#34;Huck, he must mean us both--we&#39;re right together.&#34;
<span id="L2792" class="ln">  2792</span>	
<span id="L2793" class="ln">  2793</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom, I reckon we&#39;re goners. I reckon there ain&#39;t no mistake &#39;bout
<span id="L2794" class="ln">  2794</span>	where I&#39;LL go to. I been so wicked.&#34;
<span id="L2795" class="ln">  2795</span>	
<span id="L2796" class="ln">  2796</span>	&#34;Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
<span id="L2797" class="ln">  2797</span>	feller&#39;s told NOT to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I&#39;d a tried
<span id="L2798" class="ln">  2798</span>	--but no, I wouldn&#39;t, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay
<span id="L2799" class="ln">  2799</span>	I&#39;ll just WALLER in Sunday-schools!&#34; And Tom began to snuffle a little.
<span id="L2800" class="ln">  2800</span>	
<span id="L2801" class="ln">  2801</span>	&#34;YOU bad!&#34; and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. &#34;Consound it, Tom
<span id="L2802" class="ln">  2802</span>	Sawyer, you&#39;re just old pie, &#39;longside o&#39; what I am. Oh, LORDY, lordy,
<span id="L2803" class="ln">  2803</span>	lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.&#34;
<span id="L2804" class="ln">  2804</span>	
<span id="L2805" class="ln">  2805</span>	Tom choked off and whispered:
<span id="L2806" class="ln">  2806</span>	
<span id="L2807" class="ln">  2807</span>	&#34;Look, Hucky, look! He&#39;s got his BACK to us!&#34;
<span id="L2808" class="ln">  2808</span>	
<span id="L2809" class="ln">  2809</span>	Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.
<span id="L2810" class="ln">  2810</span>	
<span id="L2811" class="ln">  2811</span>	&#34;Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?&#34;
<span id="L2812" class="ln">  2812</span>	
<span id="L2813" class="ln">  2813</span>	&#34;Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully,
<span id="L2814" class="ln">  2814</span>	you know. NOW who can he mean?&#34;
<span id="L2815" class="ln">  2815</span>	
<span id="L2816" class="ln">  2816</span>	The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.
<span id="L2817" class="ln">  2817</span>	
<span id="L2818" class="ln">  2818</span>	&#34;Sh! What&#39;s that?&#34; he whispered.
<span id="L2819" class="ln">  2819</span>	
<span id="L2820" class="ln">  2820</span>	&#34;Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it&#39;s somebody snoring, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L2821" class="ln">  2821</span>	
<span id="L2822" class="ln">  2822</span>	&#34;That IS it! Where &#39;bouts is it, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L2823" class="ln">  2823</span>	
<span id="L2824" class="ln">  2824</span>	&#34;I bleeve it&#39;s down at &#39;tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to
<span id="L2825" class="ln">  2825</span>	sleep there, sometimes, &#39;long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he
<span id="L2826" class="ln">  2826</span>	just lifts things when HE snores. Besides, I reckon he ain&#39;t ever
<span id="L2827" class="ln">  2827</span>	coming back to this town any more.&#34;
<span id="L2828" class="ln">  2828</span>	
<span id="L2829" class="ln">  2829</span>	The spirit of adventure rose in the boys&#39; souls once more.
<span id="L2830" class="ln">  2830</span>	
<span id="L2831" class="ln">  2831</span>	&#34;Hucky, do you das&#39;t to go if I lead?&#34;
<span id="L2832" class="ln">  2832</span>	
<span id="L2833" class="ln">  2833</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t like to, much. Tom, s&#39;pose it&#39;s Injun Joe!&#34;
<span id="L2834" class="ln">  2834</span>	
<span id="L2835" class="ln">  2835</span>	Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
<span id="L2836" class="ln">  2836</span>	boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to
<span id="L2837" class="ln">  2837</span>	their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily
<span id="L2838" class="ln">  2838</span>	down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps
<span id="L2839" class="ln">  2839</span>	of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap.
<span id="L2840" class="ln">  2840</span>	The man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight.
<span id="L2841" class="ln">  2841</span>	It was Muff Potter. The boys&#39; hearts had stood still, and their hopes
<span id="L2842" class="ln">  2842</span>	too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tiptoed
<span id="L2843" class="ln">  2843</span>	out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little
<span id="L2844" class="ln">  2844</span>	distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on
<span id="L2845" class="ln">  2845</span>	the night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing
<span id="L2846" class="ln">  2846</span>	within a few feet of where Potter was lying, and FACING Potter, with
<span id="L2847" class="ln">  2847</span>	his nose pointing heavenward.
<span id="L2848" class="ln">  2848</span>	
<span id="L2849" class="ln">  2849</span>	&#34;Oh, geeminy, it&#39;s HIM!&#34; exclaimed both boys, in a breath.
<span id="L2850" class="ln">  2850</span>	
<span id="L2851" class="ln">  2851</span>	&#34;Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller&#39;s
<span id="L2852" class="ln">  2852</span>	house, &#39;bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill
<span id="L2853" class="ln">  2853</span>	come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and
<span id="L2854" class="ln">  2854</span>	there ain&#39;t anybody dead there yet.&#34;
<span id="L2855" class="ln">  2855</span>	
<span id="L2856" class="ln">  2856</span>	&#34;Well, I know that. And suppose there ain&#39;t. Didn&#39;t Gracie Miller fall
<span id="L2857" class="ln">  2857</span>	in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?&#34;
<span id="L2858" class="ln">  2858</span>	
<span id="L2859" class="ln">  2859</span>	&#34;Yes, but she ain&#39;t DEAD. And what&#39;s more, she&#39;s getting better, too.&#34;
<span id="L2860" class="ln">  2860</span>	
<span id="L2861" class="ln">  2861</span>	&#34;All right, you wait and see. She&#39;s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff
<span id="L2862" class="ln">  2862</span>	Potter&#39;s a goner. That&#39;s what the niggers say, and they know all about
<span id="L2863" class="ln">  2863</span>	these kind of things, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L2864" class="ln">  2864</span>	
<span id="L2865" class="ln">  2865</span>	Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom
<span id="L2866" class="ln">  2866</span>	window the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution,
<span id="L2867" class="ln">  2867</span>	and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his
<span id="L2868" class="ln">  2868</span>	escapade. He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and
<span id="L2869" class="ln">  2869</span>	had been so for an hour.
<span id="L2870" class="ln">  2870</span>	
<span id="L2871" class="ln">  2871</span>	When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the
<span id="L2872" class="ln">  2872</span>	light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not
<span id="L2873" class="ln">  2873</span>	been called--persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled
<span id="L2874" class="ln">  2874</span>	him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,
<span id="L2875" class="ln">  2875</span>	feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had
<span id="L2876" class="ln">  2876</span>	finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were
<span id="L2877" class="ln">  2877</span>	averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a
<span id="L2878" class="ln">  2878</span>	chill to the culprit&#39;s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it
<span id="L2879" class="ln">  2879</span>	was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into
<span id="L2880" class="ln">  2880</span>	silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.
<span id="L2881" class="ln">  2881</span>	
<span id="L2882" class="ln">  2882</span>	After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in
<span id="L2883" class="ln">  2883</span>	the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt
<span id="L2884" class="ln">  2884</span>	wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;
<span id="L2885" class="ln">  2885</span>	and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray
<span id="L2886" class="ln">  2886</span>	hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any
<span id="L2887" class="ln">  2887</span>	more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom&#39;s heart was
<span id="L2888" class="ln">  2888</span>	sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised
<span id="L2889" class="ln">  2889</span>	to reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling
<span id="L2890" class="ln">  2890</span>	that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a
<span id="L2891" class="ln">  2891</span>	feeble confidence.
<span id="L2892" class="ln">  2892</span>	
<span id="L2893" class="ln">  2893</span>	He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid;
<span id="L2894" class="ln">  2894</span>	and so the latter&#39;s prompt retreat through the back gate was
<span id="L2895" class="ln">  2895</span>	unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
<span id="L2896" class="ln">  2896</span>	along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air
<span id="L2897" class="ln">  2897</span>	of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
<span id="L2898" class="ln">  2898</span>	trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
<span id="L2899" class="ln">  2899</span>	desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
<span id="L2900" class="ln">  2900</span>	stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.
<span id="L2901" class="ln">  2901</span>	His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time
<span id="L2902" class="ln">  2902</span>	he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with
<span id="L2903" class="ln">  2903</span>	a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal
<span id="L2904" class="ln">  2904</span>	sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!
<span id="L2905" class="ln">  2905</span>	
<span id="L2906" class="ln">  2906</span>	This final feather broke the camel&#39;s back.
<span id="L2907" class="ln">  2907</span>	
<span id="L2908" class="ln">  2908</span>	
<span id="L2909" class="ln">  2909</span>	
<span id="L2910" class="ln">  2910</span>	CHAPTER XI
<span id="L2911" class="ln">  2911</span>	
<span id="L2912" class="ln">  2912</span>	CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
<span id="L2913" class="ln">  2913</span>	with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet undreamed-of telegraph;
<span id="L2914" class="ln">  2914</span>	the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to
<span id="L2915" class="ln">  2915</span>	house, with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the
<span id="L2916" class="ln">  2916</span>	schoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon; the town would have
<span id="L2917" class="ln">  2917</span>	thought strangely of him if he had not.
<span id="L2918" class="ln">  2918</span>	
<span id="L2919" class="ln">  2919</span>	A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
<span id="L2920" class="ln">  2920</span>	recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter--so the story ran.
<span id="L2921" class="ln">  2921</span>	And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing
<span id="L2922" class="ln">  2922</span>	himself in the &#34;branch&#34; about one or two o&#39;clock in the morning, and
<span id="L2923" class="ln">  2923</span>	that Potter had at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances,
<span id="L2924" class="ln">  2924</span>	especially the washing which was not a habit with Potter. It was also
<span id="L2925" class="ln">  2925</span>	said that the town had been ransacked for this &#34;murderer&#34; (the public
<span id="L2926" class="ln">  2926</span>	are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a
<span id="L2927" class="ln">  2927</span>	verdict), but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed down
<span id="L2928" class="ln">  2928</span>	all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff &#34;was confident&#34; that
<span id="L2929" class="ln">  2929</span>	he would be captured before night.
<span id="L2930" class="ln">  2930</span>	
<span id="L2931" class="ln">  2931</span>	All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom&#39;s heartbreak
<span id="L2932" class="ln">  2932</span>	vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a
<span id="L2933" class="ln">  2933</span>	thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,
<span id="L2934" class="ln">  2934</span>	unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place,
<span id="L2935" class="ln">  2935</span>	he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal
<span id="L2936" class="ln">  2936</span>	spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody
<span id="L2937" class="ln">  2937</span>	pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry&#39;s. Then both
<span id="L2938" class="ln">  2938</span>	looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything
<span id="L2939" class="ln">  2939</span>	in their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the
<span id="L2940" class="ln">  2940</span>	grisly spectacle before them.
<span id="L2941" class="ln">  2941</span>	
<span id="L2942" class="ln">  2942</span>	&#34;Poor fellow!&#34; &#34;Poor young fellow!&#34; &#34;This ought to be a lesson to
<span id="L2943" class="ln">  2943</span>	grave robbers!&#34; &#34;Muff Potter&#39;ll hang for this if they catch him!&#34; This
<span id="L2944" class="ln">  2944</span>	was the drift of remark; and the minister said, &#34;It was a judgment; His
<span id="L2945" class="ln">  2945</span>	hand is here.&#34;
<span id="L2946" class="ln">  2946</span>	
<span id="L2947" class="ln">  2947</span>	Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
<span id="L2948" class="ln">  2948</span>	face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
<span id="L2949" class="ln">  2949</span>	and voices shouted, &#34;It&#39;s him! it&#39;s him! he&#39;s coming himself!&#34;
<span id="L2950" class="ln">  2950</span>	
<span id="L2951" class="ln">  2951</span>	&#34;Who? Who?&#34; from twenty voices.
<span id="L2952" class="ln">  2952</span>	
<span id="L2953" class="ln">  2953</span>	&#34;Muff Potter!&#34;
<span id="L2954" class="ln">  2954</span>	
<span id="L2955" class="ln">  2955</span>	&#34;Hallo, he&#39;s stopped!--Look out, he&#39;s turning! Don&#39;t let him get away!&#34;
<span id="L2956" class="ln">  2956</span>	
<span id="L2957" class="ln">  2957</span>	People in the branches of the trees over Tom&#39;s head said he wasn&#39;t
<span id="L2958" class="ln">  2958</span>	trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.
<span id="L2959" class="ln">  2959</span>	
<span id="L2960" class="ln">  2960</span>	&#34;Infernal impudence!&#34; said a bystander; &#34;wanted to come and take a
<span id="L2961" class="ln">  2961</span>	quiet look at his work, I reckon--didn&#39;t expect any company.&#34;
<span id="L2962" class="ln">  2962</span>	
<span id="L2963" class="ln">  2963</span>	The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through,
<span id="L2964" class="ln">  2964</span>	ostentatiously leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow&#39;s face was
<span id="L2965" class="ln">  2965</span>	haggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood
<span id="L2966" class="ln">  2966</span>	before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face
<span id="L2967" class="ln">  2967</span>	in his hands and burst into tears.
<span id="L2968" class="ln">  2968</span>	
<span id="L2969" class="ln">  2969</span>	&#34;I didn&#39;t do it, friends,&#34; he sobbed; &#34;&#39;pon my word and honor I never
<span id="L2970" class="ln">  2970</span>	done it.&#34;
<span id="L2971" class="ln">  2971</span>	
<span id="L2972" class="ln">  2972</span>	&#34;Who&#39;s accused you?&#34; shouted a voice.
<span id="L2973" class="ln">  2973</span>	
<span id="L2974" class="ln">  2974</span>	This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked
<span id="L2975" class="ln">  2975</span>	around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe,
<span id="L2976" class="ln">  2976</span>	and exclaimed:
<span id="L2977" class="ln">  2977</span>	
<span id="L2978" class="ln">  2978</span>	&#34;Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you&#39;d never--&#34;
<span id="L2979" class="ln">  2979</span>	
<span id="L2980" class="ln">  2980</span>	&#34;Is that your knife?&#34; and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.
<span id="L2981" class="ln">  2981</span>	
<span id="L2982" class="ln">  2982</span>	Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to
<span id="L2983" class="ln">  2983</span>	the ground. Then he said:
<span id="L2984" class="ln">  2984</span>	
<span id="L2985" class="ln">  2985</span>	&#34;Something told me &#39;t if I didn&#39;t come back and get--&#34; He shuddered;
<span id="L2986" class="ln">  2986</span>	then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, &#34;Tell
<span id="L2987" class="ln">  2987</span>	&#39;em, Joe, tell &#39;em--it ain&#39;t any use any more.&#34;
<span id="L2988" class="ln">  2988</span>	
<span id="L2989" class="ln">  2989</span>	Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
<span id="L2990" class="ln">  2990</span>	stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every
<span id="L2991" class="ln">  2991</span>	moment that the clear sky would deliver God&#39;s lightnings upon his head,
<span id="L2992" class="ln">  2992</span>	and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had
<span id="L2993" class="ln">  2993</span>	finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to
<span id="L2994" class="ln">  2994</span>	break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner&#39;s life faded and
<span id="L2995" class="ln">  2995</span>	vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and
<span id="L2996" class="ln">  2996</span>	it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.
<span id="L2997" class="ln">  2997</span>	
<span id="L2998" class="ln">  2998</span>	&#34;Why didn&#39;t you leave? What did you want to come here for?&#34; somebody
<span id="L2999" class="ln">  2999</span>	said.
<span id="L3000" class="ln">  3000</span>	
<span id="L3001" class="ln">  3001</span>	&#34;I couldn&#39;t help it--I couldn&#39;t help it,&#34; Potter moaned. &#34;I wanted to
<span id="L3002" class="ln">  3002</span>	run away, but I couldn&#39;t seem to come anywhere but here.&#34; And he fell
<span id="L3003" class="ln">  3003</span>	to sobbing again.
<span id="L3004" class="ln">  3004</span>	
<span id="L3005" class="ln">  3005</span>	Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
<span id="L3006" class="ln">  3006</span>	afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
<span id="L3007" class="ln">  3007</span>	lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe
<span id="L3008" class="ln">  3008</span>	had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most
<span id="L3009" class="ln">  3009</span>	balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could
<span id="L3010" class="ln">  3010</span>	not take their fascinated eyes from his face.
<span id="L3011" class="ln">  3011</span>	
<span id="L3012" class="ln">  3012</span>	They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
<span id="L3013" class="ln">  3013</span>	offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.
<span id="L3014" class="ln">  3014</span>	
<span id="L3015" class="ln">  3015</span>	Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a
<span id="L3016" class="ln">  3016</span>	wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd
<span id="L3017" class="ln">  3017</span>	that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy
<span id="L3018" class="ln">  3018</span>	circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
<span id="L3019" class="ln">  3019</span>	disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:
<span id="L3020" class="ln">  3020</span>	
<span id="L3021" class="ln">  3021</span>	&#34;It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.&#34;
<span id="L3022" class="ln">  3022</span>	
<span id="L3023" class="ln">  3023</span>	Tom&#39;s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
<span id="L3024" class="ln">  3024</span>	much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:
<span id="L3025" class="ln">  3025</span>	
<span id="L3026" class="ln">  3026</span>	&#34;Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
<span id="L3027" class="ln">  3027</span>	awake half the time.&#34;
<span id="L3028" class="ln">  3028</span>	
<span id="L3029" class="ln">  3029</span>	Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.
<span id="L3030" class="ln">  3030</span>	
<span id="L3031" class="ln">  3031</span>	&#34;It&#39;s a bad sign,&#34; said Aunt Polly, gravely. &#34;What you got on your
<span id="L3032" class="ln">  3032</span>	mind, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L3033" class="ln">  3033</span>	
<span id="L3034" class="ln">  3034</span>	&#34;Nothing. Nothing &#39;t I know of.&#34; But the boy&#39;s hand shook so that he
<span id="L3035" class="ln">  3035</span>	spilled his coffee.
<span id="L3036" class="ln">  3036</span>	
<span id="L3037" class="ln">  3037</span>	&#34;And you do talk such stuff,&#34; Sid said. &#34;Last night you said, &#39;It&#39;s
<span id="L3038" class="ln">  3038</span>	blood, it&#39;s blood, that&#39;s what it is!&#39; You said that over and over. And
<span id="L3039" class="ln">  3039</span>	you said, &#39;Don&#39;t torment me so--I&#39;ll tell!&#39; Tell WHAT? What is it
<span id="L3040" class="ln">  3040</span>	you&#39;ll tell?&#34;
<span id="L3041" class="ln">  3041</span>	
<span id="L3042" class="ln">  3042</span>	Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might
<span id="L3043" class="ln">  3043</span>	have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly&#39;s
<span id="L3044" class="ln">  3044</span>	face and she came to Tom&#39;s relief without knowing it. She said:
<span id="L3045" class="ln">  3045</span>	
<span id="L3046" class="ln">  3046</span>	&#34;Sho! It&#39;s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night
<span id="L3047" class="ln">  3047</span>	myself. Sometimes I dream it&#39;s me that done it.&#34;
<span id="L3048" class="ln">  3048</span>	
<span id="L3049" class="ln">  3049</span>	Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed
<span id="L3050" class="ln">  3050</span>	satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could,
<span id="L3051" class="ln">  3051</span>	and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his
<span id="L3052" class="ln">  3052</span>	jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and
<span id="L3053" class="ln">  3053</span>	frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow
<span id="L3054" class="ln">  3054</span>	listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage
<span id="L3055" class="ln">  3055</span>	back to its place again. Tom&#39;s distress of mind wore off gradually and
<span id="L3056" class="ln">  3056</span>	the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to
<span id="L3057" class="ln">  3057</span>	make anything out of Tom&#39;s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.
<span id="L3058" class="ln">  3058</span>	
<span id="L3059" class="ln">  3059</span>	It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
<span id="L3060" class="ln">  3060</span>	inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his
<span id="L3061" class="ln">  3061</span>	mind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,
<span id="L3062" class="ln">  3062</span>	though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;
<span id="L3063" class="ln">  3063</span>	he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was
<span id="L3064" class="ln">  3064</span>	strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a
<span id="L3065" class="ln">  3065</span>	marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided them when he
<span id="L3066" class="ln">  3066</span>	could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing. However, even inquests went out
<span id="L3067" class="ln">  3067</span>	of vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom&#39;s conscience.
<span id="L3068" class="ln">  3068</span>	
<span id="L3069" class="ln">  3069</span>	Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
<span id="L3070" class="ln">  3070</span>	opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
<span id="L3071" class="ln">  3071</span>	small comforts through to the &#34;murderer&#34; as he could get hold of. The
<span id="L3072" class="ln">  3072</span>	jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
<span id="L3073" class="ln">  3073</span>	of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was
<span id="L3074" class="ln">  3074</span>	seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom&#39;s
<span id="L3075" class="ln">  3075</span>	conscience.
<span id="L3076" class="ln">  3076</span>	
<span id="L3077" class="ln">  3077</span>	The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and
<span id="L3078" class="ln">  3078</span>	ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his
<span id="L3079" class="ln">  3079</span>	character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead
<span id="L3080" class="ln">  3080</span>	in the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of
<span id="L3081" class="ln">  3081</span>	his inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the
<span id="L3082" class="ln">  3082</span>	grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not
<span id="L3083" class="ln">  3083</span>	to try the case in the courts at present.
<span id="L3084" class="ln">  3084</span>	
<span id="L3085" class="ln">  3085</span>	
<span id="L3086" class="ln">  3086</span>	
<span id="L3087" class="ln">  3087</span>	CHAPTER XII
<span id="L3088" class="ln">  3088</span>	
<span id="L3089" class="ln">  3089</span>	ONE of the reasons why Tom&#39;s mind had drifted away from its secret
<span id="L3090" class="ln">  3090</span>	troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
<span id="L3091" class="ln">  3091</span>	itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had
<span id="L3092" class="ln">  3092</span>	struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to &#34;whistle her down the
<span id="L3093" class="ln">  3093</span>	wind,&#34; but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father&#39;s
<span id="L3094" class="ln">  3094</span>	house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she
<span id="L3095" class="ln">  3095</span>	should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an
<span id="L3096" class="ln">  3096</span>	interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there
<span id="L3097" class="ln">  3097</span>	was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;
<span id="L3098" class="ln">  3098</span>	there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to
<span id="L3099" class="ln">  3099</span>	try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are
<span id="L3100" class="ln">  3100</span>	infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of
<span id="L3101" class="ln">  3101</span>	producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in
<span id="L3102" class="ln">  3102</span>	these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
<span id="L3103" class="ln">  3103</span>	fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,
<span id="L3104" class="ln">  3104</span>	but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the
<span id="L3105" class="ln">  3105</span>	&#34;Health&#34; periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance
<span id="L3106" class="ln">  3106</span>	they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the &#34;rot&#34; they
<span id="L3107" class="ln">  3107</span>	contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,
<span id="L3108" class="ln">  3108</span>	and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and
<span id="L3109" class="ln">  3109</span>	what frame of mind to keep one&#39;s self in, and what sort of clothing to
<span id="L3110" class="ln">  3110</span>	wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her
<span id="L3111" class="ln">  3111</span>	health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
<span id="L3112" class="ln">  3112</span>	had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest
<span id="L3113" class="ln">  3113</span>	as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered
<span id="L3114" class="ln">  3114</span>	together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed
<span id="L3115" class="ln">  3115</span>	with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with
<span id="L3116" class="ln">  3116</span>	&#34;hell following after.&#34; But she never suspected that she was not an
<span id="L3117" class="ln">  3117</span>	angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering
<span id="L3118" class="ln">  3118</span>	neighbors.
<span id="L3119" class="ln">  3119</span>	
<span id="L3120" class="ln">  3120</span>	The water treatment was new, now, and Tom&#39;s low condition was a
<span id="L3121" class="ln">  3121</span>	windfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him
<span id="L3122" class="ln">  3122</span>	up in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then
<span id="L3123" class="ln">  3123</span>	she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to;
<span id="L3124" class="ln">  3124</span>	then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets
<span id="L3125" class="ln">  3125</span>	till she sweated his soul clean and &#34;the yellow stains of it came
<span id="L3126" class="ln">  3126</span>	through his pores&#34;--as Tom said.
<span id="L3127" class="ln">  3127</span>	
<span id="L3128" class="ln">  3128</span>	Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy
<span id="L3129" class="ln">  3129</span>	and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths,
<span id="L3130" class="ln">  3130</span>	and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to
<span id="L3131" class="ln">  3131</span>	assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She
<span id="L3132" class="ln">  3132</span>	calculated his capacity as she would a jug&#39;s, and filled him up every
<span id="L3133" class="ln">  3133</span>	day with quack cure-alls.
<span id="L3134" class="ln">  3134</span>	
<span id="L3135" class="ln">  3135</span>	Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase
<span id="L3136" class="ln">  3136</span>	filled the old lady&#39;s heart with consternation. This indifference must
<span id="L3137" class="ln">  3137</span>	be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first
<span id="L3138" class="ln">  3138</span>	time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with
<span id="L3139" class="ln">  3139</span>	gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water
<span id="L3140" class="ln">  3140</span>	treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She
<span id="L3141" class="ln">  3141</span>	gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
<span id="L3142" class="ln">  3142</span>	result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;
<span id="L3143" class="ln">  3143</span>	for the &#34;indifference&#34; was broken up. The boy could not have shown a
<span id="L3144" class="ln">  3144</span>	wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.
<span id="L3145" class="ln">  3145</span>	
<span id="L3146" class="ln">  3146</span>	Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
<span id="L3147" class="ln">  3147</span>	romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have
<span id="L3148" class="ln">  3148</span>	too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he
<span id="L3149" class="ln">  3149</span>	thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit pon that of
<span id="L3150" class="ln">  3150</span>	professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he
<span id="L3151" class="ln">  3151</span>	became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself
<span id="L3152" class="ln">  3152</span>	and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no
<span id="L3153" class="ln">  3153</span>	misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the
<span id="L3154" class="ln">  3154</span>	bottle clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish,
<span id="L3155" class="ln">  3155</span>	but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a
<span id="L3156" class="ln">  3156</span>	crack in the sitting-room floor with it.
<span id="L3157" class="ln">  3157</span>	
<span id="L3158" class="ln">  3158</span>	One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt&#39;s yellow
<span id="L3159" class="ln">  3159</span>	cat came along, purring, eying the teaspoon avariciously, and begging
<span id="L3160" class="ln">  3160</span>	for a taste. Tom said:
<span id="L3161" class="ln">  3161</span>	
<span id="L3162" class="ln">  3162</span>	&#34;Don&#39;t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.&#34;
<span id="L3163" class="ln">  3163</span>	
<span id="L3164" class="ln">  3164</span>	But Peter signified that he did want it.
<span id="L3165" class="ln">  3165</span>	
<span id="L3166" class="ln">  3166</span>	&#34;You better make sure.&#34;
<span id="L3167" class="ln">  3167</span>	
<span id="L3168" class="ln">  3168</span>	Peter was sure.
<span id="L3169" class="ln">  3169</span>	
<span id="L3170" class="ln">  3170</span>	&#34;Now you&#39;ve asked for it, and I&#39;ll give it to you, because there ain&#39;t
<span id="L3171" class="ln">  3171</span>	anything mean about me; but if you find you don&#39;t like it, you mustn&#39;t
<span id="L3172" class="ln">  3172</span>	blame anybody but your own self.&#34;
<span id="L3173" class="ln">  3173</span>	
<span id="L3174" class="ln">  3174</span>	Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the
<span id="L3175" class="ln">  3175</span>	Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then
<span id="L3176" class="ln">  3176</span>	delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging
<span id="L3177" class="ln">  3177</span>	against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc.
<span id="L3178" class="ln">  3178</span>	Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of
<span id="L3179" class="ln">  3179</span>	enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming
<span id="L3180" class="ln">  3180</span>	his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again
<span id="L3181" class="ln">  3181</span>	spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time
<span id="L3182" class="ln">  3182</span>	to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty
<span id="L3183" class="ln">  3183</span>	hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the
<span id="L3184" class="ln">  3184</span>	flower-pots with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment,
<span id="L3185" class="ln">  3185</span>	peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.
<span id="L3186" class="ln">  3186</span>	
<span id="L3187" class="ln">  3187</span>	&#34;Tom, what on earth ails that cat?&#34;
<span id="L3188" class="ln">  3188</span>	
<span id="L3189" class="ln">  3189</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t know, aunt,&#34; gasped the boy.
<span id="L3190" class="ln">  3190</span>	
<span id="L3191" class="ln">  3191</span>	&#34;Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?&#34;
<span id="L3192" class="ln">  3192</span>	
<span id="L3193" class="ln">  3193</span>	&#34;Deed I don&#39;t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they&#39;re having
<span id="L3194" class="ln">  3194</span>	a good time.&#34;
<span id="L3195" class="ln">  3195</span>	
<span id="L3196" class="ln">  3196</span>	&#34;They do, do they?&#34; There was something in the tone that made Tom
<span id="L3197" class="ln">  3197</span>	apprehensive.
<span id="L3198" class="ln">  3198</span>	
<span id="L3199" class="ln">  3199</span>	&#34;Yes&#39;m. That is, I believe they do.&#34;
<span id="L3200" class="ln">  3200</span>	
<span id="L3201" class="ln">  3201</span>	&#34;You DO?&#34;
<span id="L3202" class="ln">  3202</span>	
<span id="L3203" class="ln">  3203</span>	&#34;Yes&#39;m.&#34;
<span id="L3204" class="ln">  3204</span>	
<span id="L3205" class="ln">  3205</span>	The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized
<span id="L3206" class="ln">  3206</span>	by anxiety. Too late he divined her &#34;drift.&#34; The handle of the telltale
<span id="L3207" class="ln">  3207</span>	teaspoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it
<span id="L3208" class="ln">  3208</span>	up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the
<span id="L3209" class="ln">  3209</span>	usual handle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.
<span id="L3210" class="ln">  3210</span>	
<span id="L3211" class="ln">  3211</span>	&#34;Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?&#34;
<span id="L3212" class="ln">  3212</span>	
<span id="L3213" class="ln">  3213</span>	&#34;I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn&#39;t any aunt.&#34;
<span id="L3214" class="ln">  3214</span>	
<span id="L3215" class="ln">  3215</span>	&#34;Hadn&#39;t any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?&#34;
<span id="L3216" class="ln">  3216</span>	
<span id="L3217" class="ln">  3217</span>	&#34;Heaps. Because if he&#39;d had one she&#39;d a burnt him out herself! She&#39;d a
<span id="L3218" class="ln">  3218</span>	roasted his bowels out of him &#39;thout any more feeling than if he was a
<span id="L3219" class="ln">  3219</span>	human!&#34;
<span id="L3220" class="ln">  3220</span>	
<span id="L3221" class="ln">  3221</span>	Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing
<span id="L3222" class="ln">  3222</span>	in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to a boy,
<span id="L3223" class="ln">  3223</span>	too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little,
<span id="L3224" class="ln">  3224</span>	and she put her hand on Tom&#39;s head and said gently:
<span id="L3225" class="ln">  3225</span>	
<span id="L3226" class="ln">  3226</span>	&#34;I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it DID do you good.&#34;
<span id="L3227" class="ln">  3227</span>	
<span id="L3228" class="ln">  3228</span>	Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
<span id="L3229" class="ln">  3229</span>	through his gravity.
<span id="L3230" class="ln">  3230</span>	
<span id="L3231" class="ln">  3231</span>	&#34;I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter.
<span id="L3232" class="ln">  3232</span>	It done HIM good, too. I never see him get around so since--&#34;
<span id="L3233" class="ln">  3233</span>	
<span id="L3234" class="ln">  3234</span>	&#34;Oh, go &#39;long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you
<span id="L3235" class="ln">  3235</span>	try and see if you can&#39;t be a good boy, for once, and you needn&#39;t take
<span id="L3236" class="ln">  3236</span>	any more medicine.&#34;
<span id="L3237" class="ln">  3237</span>	
<span id="L3238" class="ln">  3238</span>	Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange
<span id="L3239" class="ln">  3239</span>	thing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,
<span id="L3240" class="ln">  3240</span>	he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
<span id="L3241" class="ln">  3241</span>	comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to
<span id="L3242" class="ln">  3242</span>	be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking--down the road.
<span id="L3243" class="ln">  3243</span>	Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom&#39;s face lighted; he gazed
<span id="L3244" class="ln">  3244</span>	a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom
<span id="L3245" class="ln">  3245</span>	accosted him; and &#34;led up&#34; warily to opportunities for remark about
<span id="L3246" class="ln">  3246</span>	Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
<span id="L3247" class="ln">  3247</span>	watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the
<span id="L3248" class="ln">  3248</span>	owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks
<span id="L3249" class="ln">  3249</span>	ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered
<span id="L3250" class="ln">  3250</span>	the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock
<span id="L3251" class="ln">  3251</span>	passed in at the gate, and Tom&#39;s heart gave a great bound. The next
<span id="L3252" class="ln">  3252</span>	instant he was out, and &#34;going on&#34; like an Indian; yelling, laughing,
<span id="L3253" class="ln">  3253</span>	chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing
<span id="L3254" class="ln">  3254</span>	handsprings, standing on his head--doing all the heroic things he could
<span id="L3255" class="ln">  3255</span>	conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if
<span id="L3256" class="ln">  3256</span>	Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it
<span id="L3257" class="ln">  3257</span>	all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that
<span id="L3258" class="ln">  3258</span>	he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came
<span id="L3259" class="ln">  3259</span>	war-whooping around, snatched a boy&#39;s cap, hurled it to the roof of the
<span id="L3260" class="ln">  3260</span>	schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every
<span id="L3261" class="ln">  3261</span>	direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky&#39;s nose, almost
<span id="L3262" class="ln">  3262</span>	upsetting her--and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard
<span id="L3263" class="ln">  3263</span>	her say: &#34;Mf! some people think they&#39;re mighty smart--always showing
<span id="L3264" class="ln">  3264</span>	off!&#34;
<span id="L3265" class="ln">  3265</span>	
<span id="L3266" class="ln">  3266</span>	Tom&#39;s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed
<span id="L3267" class="ln">  3267</span>	and crestfallen.
<span id="L3268" class="ln">  3268</span>	
<span id="L3269" class="ln">  3269</span>	
<span id="L3270" class="ln">  3270</span>	
<span id="L3271" class="ln">  3271</span>	CHAPTER XIII
<span id="L3272" class="ln">  3272</span>	
<span id="L3273" class="ln">  3273</span>	TOM&#39;S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a
<span id="L3274" class="ln">  3274</span>	forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found
<span id="L3275" class="ln">  3275</span>	out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had
<span id="L3276" class="ln">  3276</span>	tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since
<span id="L3277" class="ln">  3277</span>	nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them
<span id="L3278" class="ln">  3278</span>	blame HIM for the consequences--why shouldn&#39;t they? What right had the
<span id="L3279" class="ln">  3279</span>	friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he
<span id="L3280" class="ln">  3280</span>	would lead a life of crime. There was no choice.
<span id="L3281" class="ln">  3281</span>	
<span id="L3282" class="ln">  3282</span>	By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
<span id="L3283" class="ln">  3283</span>	&#34;take up&#34; tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he
<span id="L3284" class="ln">  3284</span>	should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very
<span id="L3285" class="ln">  3285</span>	hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold
<span id="L3286" class="ln">  3286</span>	world, he must submit--but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick
<span id="L3287" class="ln">  3287</span>	and fast.
<span id="L3288" class="ln">  3288</span>	
<span id="L3289" class="ln">  3289</span>	Just at this point he met his soul&#39;s sworn comrade, Joe Harper
<span id="L3290" class="ln">  3290</span>	--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.
<span id="L3291" class="ln">  3291</span>	Plainly here were &#34;two souls with but a single thought.&#34; Tom, wiping
<span id="L3292" class="ln">  3292</span>	his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a
<span id="L3293" class="ln">  3293</span>	resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
<span id="L3294" class="ln">  3294</span>	roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by
<span id="L3295" class="ln">  3295</span>	hoping that Joe would not forget him.
<span id="L3296" class="ln">  3296</span>	
<span id="L3297" class="ln">  3297</span>	But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been
<span id="L3298" class="ln">  3298</span>	going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His
<span id="L3299" class="ln">  3299</span>	mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never
<span id="L3300" class="ln">  3300</span>	tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him
<span id="L3301" class="ln">  3301</span>	and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him
<span id="L3302" class="ln">  3302</span>	to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having
<span id="L3303" class="ln">  3303</span>	driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.
<span id="L3304" class="ln">  3304</span>	
<span id="L3305" class="ln">  3305</span>	As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to
<span id="L3306" class="ln">  3306</span>	stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death
<span id="L3307" class="ln">  3307</span>	relieved them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans.
<span id="L3308" class="ln">  3308</span>	Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and
<span id="L3309" class="ln">  3309</span>	dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to
<span id="L3310" class="ln">  3310</span>	Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a
<span id="L3311" class="ln">  3311</span>	life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.
<span id="L3312" class="ln">  3312</span>	
<span id="L3313" class="ln">  3313</span>	Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi
<span id="L3314" class="ln">  3314</span>	River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded
<span id="L3315" class="ln">  3315</span>	island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as
<span id="L3316" class="ln">  3316</span>	a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
<span id="L3317" class="ln">  3317</span>	shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson&#39;s
<span id="L3318" class="ln">  3318</span>	Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
<span id="L3319" class="ln">  3319</span>	matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry
<span id="L3320" class="ln">  3320</span>	Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he
<span id="L3321" class="ln">  3321</span>	was indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on
<span id="L3322" class="ln">  3322</span>	the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which
<span id="L3323" class="ln">  3323</span>	was midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to
<span id="L3324" class="ln">  3324</span>	capture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he
<span id="L3325" class="ln">  3325</span>	could steal in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws. And
<span id="L3326" class="ln">  3326</span>	before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet
<span id="L3327" class="ln">  3327</span>	glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would &#34;hear
<span id="L3328" class="ln">  3328</span>	something.&#34; All who got this vague hint were cautioned to &#34;be mum and
<span id="L3329" class="ln">  3329</span>	wait.&#34;
<span id="L3330" class="ln">  3330</span>	
<span id="L3331" class="ln">  3331</span>	About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
<span id="L3332" class="ln">  3332</span>	and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
<span id="L3333" class="ln">  3333</span>	meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay
<span id="L3334" class="ln">  3334</span>	like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
<span id="L3335" class="ln">  3335</span>	quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under
<span id="L3336" class="ln">  3336</span>	the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
<span id="L3337" class="ln">  3337</span>	same way. Then a guarded voice said:
<span id="L3338" class="ln">  3338</span>	
<span id="L3339" class="ln">  3339</span>	&#34;Who goes there?&#34;
<span id="L3340" class="ln">  3340</span>	
<span id="L3341" class="ln">  3341</span>	&#34;Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.&#34;
<span id="L3342" class="ln">  3342</span>	
<span id="L3343" class="ln">  3343</span>	&#34;Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.&#34; Tom
<span id="L3344" class="ln">  3344</span>	had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.
<span id="L3345" class="ln">  3345</span>	
<span id="L3346" class="ln">  3346</span>	&#34;&#39;Tis well. Give the countersign.&#34;
<span id="L3347" class="ln">  3347</span>	
<span id="L3348" class="ln">  3348</span>	Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to
<span id="L3349" class="ln">  3349</span>	the brooding night:
<span id="L3350" class="ln">  3350</span>	
<span id="L3351" class="ln">  3351</span>	&#34;BLOOD!&#34;
<span id="L3352" class="ln">  3352</span>	
<span id="L3353" class="ln">  3353</span>	Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
<span id="L3354" class="ln">  3354</span>	tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was
<span id="L3355" class="ln">  3355</span>	an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it
<span id="L3356" class="ln">  3356</span>	lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.
<span id="L3357" class="ln">  3357</span>	
<span id="L3358" class="ln">  3358</span>	The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
<span id="L3359" class="ln">  3359</span>	himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
<span id="L3360" class="ln">  3360</span>	skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
<span id="L3361" class="ln">  3361</span>	a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or
<span id="L3362" class="ln">  3362</span>	&#34;chewed&#34; but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
<span id="L3363" class="ln">  3363</span>	would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;
<span id="L3364" class="ln">  3364</span>	matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire
<span id="L3365" class="ln">  3365</span>	smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went
<span id="L3366" class="ln">  3366</span>	stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an
<span id="L3367" class="ln">  3367</span>	imposing adventure of it, saying, &#34;Hist!&#34; every now and then, and
<span id="L3368" class="ln">  3368</span>	suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary
<span id="L3369" class="ln">  3369</span>	dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if &#34;the foe&#34;
<span id="L3370" class="ln">  3370</span>	stirred, to &#34;let him have it to the hilt,&#34; because &#34;dead men tell no
<span id="L3371" class="ln">  3371</span>	tales.&#34; They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the
<span id="L3372" class="ln">  3372</span>	village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no
<span id="L3373" class="ln">  3373</span>	excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.
<span id="L3374" class="ln">  3374</span>	
<span id="L3375" class="ln">  3375</span>	They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and
<span id="L3376" class="ln">  3376</span>	Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded
<span id="L3377" class="ln">  3377</span>	arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:
<span id="L3378" class="ln">  3378</span>	
<span id="L3379" class="ln">  3379</span>	&#34;Luff, and bring her to the wind!&#34;
<span id="L3380" class="ln">  3380</span>	
<span id="L3381" class="ln">  3381</span>	&#34;Aye-aye, sir!&#34;
<span id="L3382" class="ln">  3382</span>	
<span id="L3383" class="ln">  3383</span>	&#34;Steady, steady-y-y-y!&#34;
<span id="L3384" class="ln">  3384</span>	
<span id="L3385" class="ln">  3385</span>	&#34;Steady it is, sir!&#34;
<span id="L3386" class="ln">  3386</span>	
<span id="L3387" class="ln">  3387</span>	&#34;Let her go off a point!&#34;
<span id="L3388" class="ln">  3388</span>	
<span id="L3389" class="ln">  3389</span>	&#34;Point it is, sir!&#34;
<span id="L3390" class="ln">  3390</span>	
<span id="L3391" class="ln">  3391</span>	As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream
<span id="L3392" class="ln">  3392</span>	it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
<span id="L3393" class="ln">  3393</span>	&#34;style,&#34; and were not intended to mean anything in particular.
<span id="L3394" class="ln">  3394</span>	
<span id="L3395" class="ln">  3395</span>	&#34;What sail&#39;s she carrying?&#34;
<span id="L3396" class="ln">  3396</span>	
<span id="L3397" class="ln">  3397</span>	&#34;Courses, tops&#39;ls, and flying-jib, sir.&#34;
<span id="L3398" class="ln">  3398</span>	
<span id="L3399" class="ln">  3399</span>	&#34;Send the r&#39;yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye
<span id="L3400" class="ln">  3400</span>	--foretopmaststuns&#39;l! Lively, now!&#34;
<span id="L3401" class="ln">  3401</span>	
<span id="L3402" class="ln">  3402</span>	&#34;Aye-aye, sir!&#34;
<span id="L3403" class="ln">  3403</span>	
<span id="L3404" class="ln">  3404</span>	&#34;Shake out that maintogalans&#39;l! Sheets and braces! NOW my hearties!&#34;
<span id="L3405" class="ln">  3405</span>	
<span id="L3406" class="ln">  3406</span>	&#34;Aye-aye, sir!&#34;
<span id="L3407" class="ln">  3407</span>	
<span id="L3408" class="ln">  3408</span>	&#34;Hellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,
<span id="L3409" class="ln">  3409</span>	port! NOW, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!&#34;
<span id="L3410" class="ln">  3410</span>	
<span id="L3411" class="ln">  3411</span>	&#34;Steady it is, sir!&#34;
<span id="L3412" class="ln">  3412</span>	
<span id="L3413" class="ln">  3413</span>	The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her
<span id="L3414" class="ln">  3414</span>	head right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so
<span id="L3415" class="ln">  3415</span>	there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was
<span id="L3416" class="ln">  3416</span>	said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was
<span id="L3417" class="ln">  3417</span>	passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed
<span id="L3418" class="ln">  3418</span>	where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of
<span id="L3419" class="ln">  3419</span>	star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening.
<span id="L3420" class="ln">  3420</span>	The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, &#34;looking his last&#34; upon
<span id="L3421" class="ln">  3421</span>	the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing
<span id="L3422" class="ln">  3422</span>	&#34;she&#34; could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death
<span id="L3423" class="ln">  3423</span>	with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips.
<span id="L3424" class="ln">  3424</span>	It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson&#39;s Island
<span id="L3425" class="ln">  3425</span>	beyond eyeshot of the village, and so he &#34;looked his last&#34; with a
<span id="L3426" class="ln">  3426</span>	broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last,
<span id="L3427" class="ln">  3427</span>	too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the
<span id="L3428" class="ln">  3428</span>	current drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered
<span id="L3429" class="ln">  3429</span>	the danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o&#39;clock in
<span id="L3430" class="ln">  3430</span>	the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the
<span id="L3431" class="ln">  3431</span>	head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed
<span id="L3432" class="ln">  3432</span>	their freight. Part of the little raft&#39;s belongings consisted of an old
<span id="L3433" class="ln">  3433</span>	sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to
<span id="L3434" class="ln">  3434</span>	shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open
<span id="L3435" class="ln">  3435</span>	air in good weather, as became outlaws.
<span id="L3436" class="ln">  3436</span>	
<span id="L3437" class="ln">  3437</span>	They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty
<span id="L3438" class="ln">  3438</span>	steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some
<span id="L3439" class="ln">  3439</span>	bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn &#34;pone&#34;
<span id="L3440" class="ln">  3440</span>	stock they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that
<span id="L3441" class="ln">  3441</span>	wild, free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited
<span id="L3442" class="ln">  3442</span>	island, far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would
<span id="L3443" class="ln">  3443</span>	return to civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw
<span id="L3444" class="ln">  3444</span>	its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple,
<span id="L3445" class="ln">  3445</span>	and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.
<span id="L3446" class="ln">  3446</span>	
<span id="L3447" class="ln">  3447</span>	When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of
<span id="L3448" class="ln">  3448</span>	corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,
<span id="L3449" class="ln">  3449</span>	filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but they
<span id="L3450" class="ln">  3450</span>	would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
<span id="L3451" class="ln">  3451</span>	camp-fire.
<span id="L3452" class="ln">  3452</span>	
<span id="L3453" class="ln">  3453</span>	&#34;AIN&#39;T it gay?&#34; said Joe.
<span id="L3454" class="ln">  3454</span>	
<span id="L3455" class="ln">  3455</span>	&#34;It&#39;s NUTS!&#34; said Tom. &#34;What would the boys say if they could see us?&#34;
<span id="L3456" class="ln">  3456</span>	
<span id="L3457" class="ln">  3457</span>	&#34;Say? Well, they&#39;d just die to be here--hey, Hucky!&#34;
<span id="L3458" class="ln">  3458</span>	
<span id="L3459" class="ln">  3459</span>	&#34;I reckon so,&#34; said Huckleberry; &#34;anyways, I&#39;m suited. I don&#39;t want
<span id="L3460" class="ln">  3460</span>	nothing better&#39;n this. I don&#39;t ever get enough to eat, gen&#39;ally--and
<span id="L3461" class="ln">  3461</span>	here they can&#39;t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.&#34;
<span id="L3462" class="ln">  3462</span>	
<span id="L3463" class="ln">  3463</span>	&#34;It&#39;s just the life for me,&#34; said Tom. &#34;You don&#39;t have to get up,
<span id="L3464" class="ln">  3464</span>	mornings, and you don&#39;t have to go to school, and wash, and all that
<span id="L3465" class="ln">  3465</span>	blame foolishness. You see a pirate don&#39;t have to do ANYTHING, Joe,
<span id="L3466" class="ln">  3466</span>	when he&#39;s ashore, but a hermit HE has to be praying considerable, and
<span id="L3467" class="ln">  3467</span>	then he don&#39;t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.&#34;
<span id="L3468" class="ln">  3468</span>	
<span id="L3469" class="ln">  3469</span>	&#34;Oh yes, that&#39;s so,&#34; said Joe, &#34;but I hadn&#39;t thought much about it,
<span id="L3470" class="ln">  3470</span>	you know. I&#39;d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I&#39;ve tried it.&#34;
<span id="L3471" class="ln">  3471</span>	
<span id="L3472" class="ln">  3472</span>	&#34;You see,&#34; said Tom, &#34;people don&#39;t go much on hermits, nowadays, like
<span id="L3473" class="ln">  3473</span>	they used to in old times, but a pirate&#39;s always respected. And a
<span id="L3474" class="ln">  3474</span>	hermit&#39;s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put
<span id="L3475" class="ln">  3475</span>	sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--&#34;
<span id="L3476" class="ln">  3476</span>	
<span id="L3477" class="ln">  3477</span>	&#34;What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?&#34; inquired Huck.
<span id="L3478" class="ln">  3478</span>	
<span id="L3479" class="ln">  3479</span>	&#34;I dono. But they&#39;ve GOT to do it. Hermits always do. You&#39;d have to do
<span id="L3480" class="ln">  3480</span>	that if you was a hermit.&#34;
<span id="L3481" class="ln">  3481</span>	
<span id="L3482" class="ln">  3482</span>	&#34;Dern&#39;d if I would,&#34; said Huck.
<span id="L3483" class="ln">  3483</span>	
<span id="L3484" class="ln">  3484</span>	&#34;Well, what would you do?&#34;
<span id="L3485" class="ln">  3485</span>	
<span id="L3486" class="ln">  3486</span>	&#34;I dono. But I wouldn&#39;t do that.&#34;
<span id="L3487" class="ln">  3487</span>	
<span id="L3488" class="ln">  3488</span>	&#34;Why, Huck, you&#39;d HAVE to. How&#39;d you get around it?&#34;
<span id="L3489" class="ln">  3489</span>	
<span id="L3490" class="ln">  3490</span>	&#34;Why, I just wouldn&#39;t stand it. I&#39;d run away.&#34;
<span id="L3491" class="ln">  3491</span>	
<span id="L3492" class="ln">  3492</span>	&#34;Run away! Well, you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You&#39;d be
<span id="L3493" class="ln">  3493</span>	a disgrace.&#34;
<span id="L3494" class="ln">  3494</span>	
<span id="L3495" class="ln">  3495</span>	The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had
<span id="L3496" class="ln">  3496</span>	finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded
<span id="L3497" class="ln">  3497</span>	it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a
<span id="L3498" class="ln">  3498</span>	cloud of fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious
<span id="L3499" class="ln">  3499</span>	contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and
<span id="L3500" class="ln">  3500</span>	secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:
<span id="L3501" class="ln">  3501</span>	
<span id="L3502" class="ln">  3502</span>	&#34;What does pirates have to do?&#34;
<span id="L3503" class="ln">  3503</span>	
<span id="L3504" class="ln">  3504</span>	Tom said:
<span id="L3505" class="ln">  3505</span>	
<span id="L3506" class="ln">  3506</span>	&#34;Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get
<span id="L3507" class="ln">  3507</span>	the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there&#39;s
<span id="L3508" class="ln">  3508</span>	ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make
<span id="L3509" class="ln">  3509</span>	&#39;em walk a plank.&#34;
<span id="L3510" class="ln">  3510</span>	
<span id="L3511" class="ln">  3511</span>	&#34;And they carry the women to the island,&#34; said Joe; &#34;they don&#39;t kill
<span id="L3512" class="ln">  3512</span>	the women.&#34;
<span id="L3513" class="ln">  3513</span>	
<span id="L3514" class="ln">  3514</span>	&#34;No,&#34; assented Tom, &#34;they don&#39;t kill the women--they&#39;re too noble. And
<span id="L3515" class="ln">  3515</span>	the women&#39;s always beautiful, too.
<span id="L3516" class="ln">  3516</span>	
<span id="L3517" class="ln">  3517</span>	&#34;And don&#39;t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver
<span id="L3518" class="ln">  3518</span>	and di&#39;monds,&#34; said Joe, with enthusiasm.
<span id="L3519" class="ln">  3519</span>	
<span id="L3520" class="ln">  3520</span>	&#34;Who?&#34; said Huck.
<span id="L3521" class="ln">  3521</span>	
<span id="L3522" class="ln">  3522</span>	&#34;Why, the pirates.&#34;
<span id="L3523" class="ln">  3523</span>	
<span id="L3524" class="ln">  3524</span>	Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.
<span id="L3525" class="ln">  3525</span>	
<span id="L3526" class="ln">  3526</span>	&#34;I reckon I ain&#39;t dressed fitten for a pirate,&#34; said he, with a
<span id="L3527" class="ln">  3527</span>	regretful pathos in his voice; &#34;but I ain&#39;t got none but these.&#34;
<span id="L3528" class="ln">  3528</span>	
<span id="L3529" class="ln">  3529</span>	But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
<span id="L3530" class="ln">  3530</span>	after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand
<span id="L3531" class="ln">  3531</span>	that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
<span id="L3532" class="ln">  3532</span>	wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.
<span id="L3533" class="ln">  3533</span>	
<span id="L3534" class="ln">  3534</span>	Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
<span id="L3535" class="ln">  3535</span>	eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
<span id="L3536" class="ln">  3536</span>	Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the
<span id="L3537" class="ln">  3537</span>	weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main
<span id="L3538" class="ln">  3538</span>	had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers
<span id="L3539" class="ln">  3539</span>	inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority
<span id="L3540" class="ln">  3540</span>	to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to
<span id="L3541" class="ln">  3541</span>	say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as
<span id="L3542" class="ln">  3542</span>	that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from
<span id="L3543" class="ln">  3543</span>	heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge
<span id="L3544" class="ln">  3544</span>	of sleep--but an intruder came, now, that would not &#34;down.&#34; It was
<span id="L3545" class="ln">  3545</span>	conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing
<span id="L3546" class="ln">  3546</span>	wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then
<span id="L3547" class="ln">  3547</span>	the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding
<span id="L3548" class="ln">  3548</span>	conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of
<span id="L3549" class="ln">  3549</span>	times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin
<span id="L3550" class="ln">  3550</span>	plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no
<span id="L3551" class="ln">  3551</span>	getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only
<span id="L3552" class="ln">  3552</span>	&#34;hooking,&#34; while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain
<span id="L3553" class="ln">  3553</span>	simple stealing--and there was a command against that in the Bible. So
<span id="L3554" class="ln">  3554</span>	they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business,
<span id="L3555" class="ln">  3555</span>	their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.
<span id="L3556" class="ln">  3556</span>	Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent
<span id="L3557" class="ln">  3557</span>	pirates fell peacefully to sleep.
<span id="L3558" class="ln">  3558</span>	
<span id="L3559" class="ln">  3559</span>	
<span id="L3560" class="ln">  3560</span>	
<span id="L3561" class="ln">  3561</span>	CHAPTER XIV
<span id="L3562" class="ln">  3562</span>	
<span id="L3563" class="ln">  3563</span>	WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
<span id="L3564" class="ln">  3564</span>	rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the
<span id="L3565" class="ln">  3565</span>	cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in
<span id="L3566" class="ln">  3566</span>	the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred;
<span id="L3567" class="ln">  3567</span>	not a sound obtruded upon great Nature&#39;s meditation. Beaded dewdrops
<span id="L3568" class="ln">  3568</span>	stood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the
<span id="L3569" class="ln">  3569</span>	fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe
<span id="L3570" class="ln">  3570</span>	and Huck still slept.
<span id="L3571" class="ln">  3571</span>	
<span id="L3572" class="ln">  3572</span>	Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently
<span id="L3573" class="ln">  3573</span>	the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of
<span id="L3574" class="ln">  3574</span>	the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
<span id="L3575" class="ln">  3575</span>	manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to
<span id="L3576" class="ln">  3576</span>	work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came
<span id="L3577" class="ln">  3577</span>	crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
<span id="L3578" class="ln">  3578</span>	from time to time and &#34;sniffing around,&#34; then proceeding again--for he
<span id="L3579" class="ln">  3579</span>	was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
<span id="L3580" class="ln">  3580</span>	accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
<span id="L3581" class="ln">  3581</span>	by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
<span id="L3582" class="ln">  3582</span>	go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
<span id="L3583" class="ln">  3583</span>	curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom&#39;s leg and
<span id="L3584" class="ln">  3584</span>	began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that
<span id="L3585" class="ln">  3585</span>	he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a
<span id="L3586" class="ln">  3586</span>	doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,
<span id="L3587" class="ln">  3587</span>	from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
<span id="L3588" class="ln">  3588</span>	manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
<span id="L3589" class="ln">  3589</span>	and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug
<span id="L3590" class="ln">  3590</span>	climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to
<span id="L3591" class="ln">  3591</span>	it and said, &#34;Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire,
<span id="L3592" class="ln">  3592</span>	your children&#39;s alone,&#34; and she took wing and went off to see about it
<span id="L3593" class="ln">  3593</span>	--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
<span id="L3594" class="ln">  3594</span>	credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its
<span id="L3595" class="ln">  3595</span>	simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at
<span id="L3596" class="ln">  3596</span>	its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against
<span id="L3597" class="ln">  3597</span>	its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this
<span id="L3598" class="ln">  3598</span>	time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom&#39;s head,
<span id="L3599" class="ln">  3599</span>	and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of
<span id="L3600" class="ln">  3600</span>	enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and
<span id="L3601" class="ln">  3601</span>	stopped on a twig almost within the boy&#39;s reach, cocked his head to one
<span id="L3602" class="ln">  3602</span>	side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel
<span id="L3603" class="ln">  3603</span>	and a big fellow of the &#34;fox&#34; kind came skurrying along, sitting up at
<span id="L3604" class="ln">  3604</span>	intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had
<span id="L3605" class="ln">  3605</span>	probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to
<span id="L3606" class="ln">  3606</span>	be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long
<span id="L3607" class="ln">  3607</span>	lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near,
<span id="L3608" class="ln">  3608</span>	and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.
<span id="L3609" class="ln">  3609</span>	
<span id="L3610" class="ln">  3610</span>	Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a
<span id="L3611" class="ln">  3611</span>	shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
<span id="L3612" class="ln">  3612</span>	tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
<span id="L3613" class="ln">  3613</span>	sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
<span id="L3614" class="ln">  3614</span>	distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a
<span id="L3615" class="ln">  3615</span>	slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only
<span id="L3616" class="ln">  3616</span>	gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge
<span id="L3617" class="ln">  3617</span>	between them and civilization.
<span id="L3618" class="ln">  3618</span>	
<span id="L3619" class="ln">  3619</span>	They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
<span id="L3620" class="ln">  3620</span>	ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found
<span id="L3621" class="ln">  3621</span>	a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad
<span id="L3622" class="ln">  3622</span>	oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a
<span id="L3623" class="ln">  3623</span>	wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee.
<span id="L3624" class="ln">  3624</span>	While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to
<span id="L3625" class="ln">  3625</span>	hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank
<span id="L3626" class="ln">  3626</span>	and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had
<span id="L3627" class="ln">  3627</span>	not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some
<span id="L3628" class="ln">  3628</span>	handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions
<span id="L3629" class="ln">  3629</span>	enough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were
<span id="L3630" class="ln">  3630</span>	astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did
<span id="L3631" class="ln">  3631</span>	not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is
<span id="L3632" class="ln">  3632</span>	caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce
<span id="L3633" class="ln">  3633</span>	open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient
<span id="L3634" class="ln">  3634</span>	of hunger make, too.
<span id="L3635" class="ln">  3635</span>	
<span id="L3636" class="ln">  3636</span>	They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
<span id="L3637" class="ln">  3637</span>	and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They
<span id="L3638" class="ln">  3638</span>	tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,
<span id="L3639" class="ln">  3639</span>	among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the
<span id="L3640" class="ln">  3640</span>	ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came
<span id="L3641" class="ln">  3641</span>	upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.
<span id="L3642" class="ln">  3642</span>	
<span id="L3643" class="ln">  3643</span>	They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
<span id="L3644" class="ln">  3644</span>	astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles
<span id="L3645" class="ln">  3645</span>	long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to
<span id="L3646" class="ln">  3646</span>	was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
<span id="L3647" class="ln">  3647</span>	wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the
<span id="L3648" class="ln">  3648</span>	middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too
<span id="L3649" class="ln">  3649</span>	hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and
<span id="L3650" class="ln">  3650</span>	then threw themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon
<span id="L3651" class="ln">  3651</span>	began to drag, and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded
<span id="L3652" class="ln">  3652</span>	in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the
<span id="L3653" class="ln">  3653</span>	spirits of the boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing
<span id="L3654" class="ln">  3654</span>	crept upon them. This took dim shape, presently--it was budding
<span id="L3655" class="ln">  3655</span>	homesickness. Even Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps
<span id="L3656" class="ln">  3656</span>	and empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of their weakness, and
<span id="L3657" class="ln">  3657</span>	none was brave enough to speak his thought.
<span id="L3658" class="ln">  3658</span>	
<span id="L3659" class="ln">  3659</span>	For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
<span id="L3660" class="ln">  3660</span>	sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
<span id="L3661" class="ln">  3661</span>	clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound
<span id="L3662" class="ln">  3662</span>	became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,
<span id="L3663" class="ln">  3663</span>	glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude.
<span id="L3664" class="ln">  3664</span>	There was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen
<span id="L3665" class="ln">  3665</span>	boom came floating down out of the distance.
<span id="L3666" class="ln">  3666</span>	
<span id="L3667" class="ln">  3667</span>	&#34;What is it!&#34; exclaimed Joe, under his breath.
<span id="L3668" class="ln">  3668</span>	
<span id="L3669" class="ln">  3669</span>	&#34;I wonder,&#34; said Tom in a whisper.
<span id="L3670" class="ln">  3670</span>	
<span id="L3671" class="ln">  3671</span>	&#34;&#39;Tain&#39;t thunder,&#34; said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, &#34;becuz thunder--&#34;
<span id="L3672" class="ln">  3672</span>	
<span id="L3673" class="ln">  3673</span>	&#34;Hark!&#34; said Tom. &#34;Listen--don&#39;t talk.&#34;
<span id="L3674" class="ln">  3674</span>	
<span id="L3675" class="ln">  3675</span>	They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
<span id="L3676" class="ln">  3676</span>	troubled the solemn hush.
<span id="L3677" class="ln">  3677</span>	
<span id="L3678" class="ln">  3678</span>	&#34;Let&#39;s go and see.&#34;
<span id="L3679" class="ln">  3679</span>	
<span id="L3680" class="ln">  3680</span>	They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town.
<span id="L3681" class="ln">  3681</span>	They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The
<span id="L3682" class="ln">  3682</span>	little steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village, drifting
<span id="L3683" class="ln">  3683</span>	with the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were
<span id="L3684" class="ln">  3684</span>	a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the
<span id="L3685" class="ln">  3685</span>	neighborhood of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what
<span id="L3686" class="ln">  3686</span>	the men in them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst
<span id="L3687" class="ln">  3687</span>	from the ferryboat&#39;s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud,
<span id="L3688" class="ln">  3688</span>	that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.
<span id="L3689" class="ln">  3689</span>	
<span id="L3690" class="ln">  3690</span>	&#34;I know now!&#34; exclaimed Tom; &#34;somebody&#39;s drownded!&#34;
<span id="L3691" class="ln">  3691</span>	
<span id="L3692" class="ln">  3692</span>	&#34;That&#39;s it!&#34; said Huck; &#34;they done that last summer, when Bill Turner
<span id="L3693" class="ln">  3693</span>	got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him
<span id="L3694" class="ln">  3694</span>	come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
<span id="L3695" class="ln">  3695</span>	quicksilver in &#39;em and set &#39;em afloat, and wherever there&#39;s anybody
<span id="L3696" class="ln">  3696</span>	that&#39;s drownded, they&#39;ll float right there and stop.&#34;
<span id="L3697" class="ln">  3697</span>	
<span id="L3698" class="ln">  3698</span>	&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve heard about that,&#34; said Joe. &#34;I wonder what makes the bread
<span id="L3699" class="ln">  3699</span>	do that.&#34;
<span id="L3700" class="ln">  3700</span>	
<span id="L3701" class="ln">  3701</span>	&#34;Oh, it ain&#39;t the bread, so much,&#34; said Tom; &#34;I reckon it&#39;s mostly
<span id="L3702" class="ln">  3702</span>	what they SAY over it before they start it out.&#34;
<span id="L3703" class="ln">  3703</span>	
<span id="L3704" class="ln">  3704</span>	&#34;But they don&#39;t say anything over it,&#34; said Huck. &#34;I&#39;ve seen &#39;em and
<span id="L3705" class="ln">  3705</span>	they don&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L3706" class="ln">  3706</span>	
<span id="L3707" class="ln">  3707</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s funny,&#34; said Tom. &#34;But maybe they say it to themselves.
<span id="L3708" class="ln">  3708</span>	Of COURSE they do. Anybody might know that.&#34;
<span id="L3709" class="ln">  3709</span>	
<span id="L3710" class="ln">  3710</span>	The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because
<span id="L3711" class="ln">  3711</span>	an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be
<span id="L3712" class="ln">  3712</span>	expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
<span id="L3713" class="ln">  3713</span>	gravity.
<span id="L3714" class="ln">  3714</span>	
<span id="L3715" class="ln">  3715</span>	&#34;By jings, I wish I was over there, now,&#34; said Joe.
<span id="L3716" class="ln">  3716</span>	
<span id="L3717" class="ln">  3717</span>	&#34;I do too&#34; said Huck &#34;I&#39;d give heaps to know who it is.&#34;
<span id="L3718" class="ln">  3718</span>	
<span id="L3719" class="ln">  3719</span>	The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought
<span id="L3720" class="ln">  3720</span>	flashed through Tom&#39;s mind, and he exclaimed:
<span id="L3721" class="ln">  3721</span>	
<span id="L3722" class="ln">  3722</span>	&#34;Boys, I know who&#39;s drownded--it&#39;s us!&#34;
<span id="L3723" class="ln">  3723</span>	
<span id="L3724" class="ln">  3724</span>	They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they
<span id="L3725" class="ln">  3725</span>	were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;
<span id="L3726" class="ln">  3726</span>	tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
<span id="L3727" class="ln">  3727</span>	lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
<span id="L3728" class="ln">  3728</span>	indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole
<span id="L3729" class="ln">  3729</span>	town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety
<span id="L3730" class="ln">  3730</span>	was concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after
<span id="L3731" class="ln">  3731</span>	all.
<span id="L3732" class="ln">  3732</span>	
<span id="L3733" class="ln">  3733</span>	As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed
<span id="L3734" class="ln">  3734</span>	business and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They
<span id="L3735" class="ln">  3735</span>	were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious
<span id="L3736" class="ln">  3736</span>	trouble they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it,
<span id="L3737" class="ln">  3737</span>	and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying
<span id="L3738" class="ln">  3738</span>	about them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their
<span id="L3739" class="ln">  3739</span>	account were gratifying to look upon--from their point of view. But
<span id="L3740" class="ln">  3740</span>	when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to
<span id="L3741" class="ln">  3741</span>	talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently
<span id="L3742" class="ln">  3742</span>	wandering elsewhere. The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe
<span id="L3743" class="ln">  3743</span>	could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not
<span id="L3744" class="ln">  3744</span>	enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came; they
<span id="L3745" class="ln">  3745</span>	grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by
<span id="L3746" class="ln">  3746</span>	Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout &#34;feeler&#34; as to how the others
<span id="L3747" class="ln">  3747</span>	might look upon a return to civilization--not right now, but--
<span id="L3748" class="ln">  3748</span>	
<span id="L3749" class="ln">  3749</span>	Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined
<span id="L3750" class="ln">  3750</span>	in with Tom, and the waverer quickly &#34;explained,&#34; and was glad to get
<span id="L3751" class="ln">  3751</span>	out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted homesickness
<span id="L3752" class="ln">  3752</span>	clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to
<span id="L3753" class="ln">  3753</span>	rest for the moment.
<span id="L3754" class="ln">  3754</span>	
<span id="L3755" class="ln">  3755</span>	As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore. Joe
<span id="L3756" class="ln">  3756</span>	followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,
<span id="L3757" class="ln">  3757</span>	watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,
<span id="L3758" class="ln">  3758</span>	and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
<span id="L3759" class="ln">  3759</span>	by the camp-fire. He picked up and inspected several large
<span id="L3760" class="ln">  3760</span>	semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose
<span id="L3761" class="ln">  3761</span>	two which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully
<span id="L3762" class="ln">  3762</span>	wrote something upon each of these with his &#34;red keel&#34;; one he rolled up
<span id="L3763" class="ln">  3763</span>	and put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe&#39;s hat and
<span id="L3764" class="ln">  3764</span>	removed it to a little distance from the owner. And he also put into the
<span id="L3765" class="ln">  3765</span>	hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them
<span id="L3766" class="ln">  3766</span>	a lump of chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that
<span id="L3767" class="ln">  3767</span>	kind of marbles known as a &#34;sure &#39;nough crystal.&#34; Then he tiptoed his
<span id="L3768" class="ln">  3768</span>	way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing,
<span id="L3769" class="ln">  3769</span>	and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.
<span id="L3770" class="ln">  3770</span>	
<span id="L3771" class="ln">  3771</span>	
<span id="L3772" class="ln">  3772</span>	
<span id="L3773" class="ln">  3773</span>	CHAPTER XV
<span id="L3774" class="ln">  3774</span>	
<span id="L3775" class="ln">  3775</span>	A FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading
<span id="L3776" class="ln">  3776</span>	toward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was
<span id="L3777" class="ln">  3777</span>	half-way over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he
<span id="L3778" class="ln">  3778</span>	struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam
<span id="L3779" class="ln">  3779</span>	quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he
<span id="L3780" class="ln">  3780</span>	had expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along
<span id="L3781" class="ln">  3781</span>	till he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his
<span id="L3782" class="ln">  3782</span>	jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through
<span id="L3783" class="ln">  3783</span>	the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before
<span id="L3784" class="ln">  3784</span>	ten o&#39;clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and
<span id="L3785" class="ln">  3785</span>	saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.
<span id="L3786" class="ln">  3786</span>	Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank,
<span id="L3787" class="ln">  3787</span>	watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four
<span id="L3788" class="ln">  3788</span>	strokes and climbed into the skiff that did &#34;yawl&#34; duty at the boat&#39;s
<span id="L3789" class="ln">  3789</span>	stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.
<span id="L3790" class="ln">  3790</span>	
<span id="L3791" class="ln">  3791</span>	Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to &#34;cast
<span id="L3792" class="ln">  3792</span>	off.&#34; A minute or two later the skiff&#39;s head was standing high up,
<span id="L3793" class="ln">  3793</span>	against the boat&#39;s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in
<span id="L3794" class="ln">  3794</span>	his success, for he knew it was the boat&#39;s last trip for the night. At
<span id="L3795" class="ln">  3795</span>	the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom
<span id="L3796" class="ln">  3796</span>	slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
<span id="L3797" class="ln">  3797</span>	downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.
<span id="L3798" class="ln">  3798</span>	
<span id="L3799" class="ln">  3799</span>	He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
<span id="L3800" class="ln">  3800</span>	aunt&#39;s back fence. He climbed over, approached the &#34;ell,&#34; and looked in
<span id="L3801" class="ln">  3801</span>	at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There sat
<span id="L3802" class="ln">  3802</span>	Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper&#39;s mother, grouped together,
<span id="L3803" class="ln">  3803</span>	talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
<span id="L3804" class="ln">  3804</span>	door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he
<span id="L3805" class="ln">  3805</span>	pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
<span id="L3806" class="ln">  3806</span>	cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
<span id="L3807" class="ln">  3807</span>	squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
<span id="L3808" class="ln">  3808</span>	warily.
<span id="L3809" class="ln">  3809</span>	
<span id="L3810" class="ln">  3810</span>	&#34;What makes the candle blow so?&#34; said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up.
<span id="L3811" class="ln">  3811</span>	&#34;Why, that door&#39;s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of
<span id="L3812" class="ln">  3812</span>	strange things now. Go &#39;long and shut it, Sid.&#34;
<span id="L3813" class="ln">  3813</span>	
<span id="L3814" class="ln">  3814</span>	Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and &#34;breathed&#34;
<span id="L3815" class="ln">  3815</span>	himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
<span id="L3816" class="ln">  3816</span>	aunt&#39;s foot.
<span id="L3817" class="ln">  3817</span>	
<span id="L3818" class="ln">  3818</span>	&#34;But as I was saying,&#34; said Aunt Polly, &#34;he warn&#39;t BAD, so to say
<span id="L3819" class="ln">  3819</span>	--only mischEEvous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He
<span id="L3820" class="ln">  3820</span>	warn&#39;t any more responsible than a colt. HE never meant any harm, and
<span id="L3821" class="ln">  3821</span>	he was the best-hearted boy that ever was&#34;--and she began to cry.
<span id="L3822" class="ln">  3822</span>	
<span id="L3823" class="ln">  3823</span>	&#34;It was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to
<span id="L3824" class="ln">  3824</span>	every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
<span id="L3825" class="ln">  3825</span>	could be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking
<span id="L3826" class="ln">  3826</span>	that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself
<span id="L3827" class="ln">  3827</span>	because it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never,
<span id="L3828" class="ln">  3828</span>	never, never, poor abused boy!&#34; And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart
<span id="L3829" class="ln">  3829</span>	would break.
<span id="L3830" class="ln">  3830</span>	
<span id="L3831" class="ln">  3831</span>	&#34;I hope Tom&#39;s better off where he is,&#34; said Sid, &#34;but if he&#39;d been
<span id="L3832" class="ln">  3832</span>	better in some ways--&#34;
<span id="L3833" class="ln">  3833</span>	
<span id="L3834" class="ln">  3834</span>	&#34;SID!&#34; Tom felt the glare of the old lady&#39;s eye, though he could not
<span id="L3835" class="ln">  3835</span>	see it. &#34;Not a word against my Tom, now that he&#39;s gone! God&#39;ll take
<span id="L3836" class="ln">  3836</span>	care of HIM--never you trouble YOURself, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don&#39;t
<span id="L3837" class="ln">  3837</span>	know how to give him up! I don&#39;t know how to give him up! He was such a
<span id="L3838" class="ln">  3838</span>	comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, &#39;most.&#34;
<span id="L3839" class="ln">  3839</span>	
<span id="L3840" class="ln">  3840</span>	&#34;The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of
<span id="L3841" class="ln">  3841</span>	the Lord! But it&#39;s so hard--Oh, it&#39;s so hard! Only last Saturday my
<span id="L3842" class="ln">  3842</span>	Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him
<span id="L3843" class="ln">  3843</span>	sprawling. Little did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over
<span id="L3844" class="ln">  3844</span>	again I&#39;d hug him and bless him for it.&#34;
<span id="L3845" class="ln">  3845</span>	
<span id="L3846" class="ln">  3846</span>	&#34;Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just
<span id="L3847" class="ln">  3847</span>	exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took
<span id="L3848" class="ln">  3848</span>	and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur
<span id="L3849" class="ln">  3849</span>	would tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom&#39;s head
<span id="L3850" class="ln">  3850</span>	with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he&#39;s out of all his
<span id="L3851" class="ln">  3851</span>	troubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--&#34;
<span id="L3852" class="ln">  3852</span>	
<span id="L3853" class="ln">  3853</span>	But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
<span id="L3854" class="ln">  3854</span>	down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than
<span id="L3855" class="ln">  3855</span>	anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word
<span id="L3856" class="ln">  3856</span>	for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself
<span id="L3857" class="ln">  3857</span>	than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt&#39;s
<span id="L3858" class="ln">  3858</span>	grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with
<span id="L3859" class="ln">  3859</span>	joy--and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to
<span id="L3860" class="ln">  3860</span>	his nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.
<span id="L3861" class="ln">  3861</span>	
<span id="L3862" class="ln">  3862</span>	He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
<span id="L3863" class="ln">  3863</span>	conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;
<span id="L3864" class="ln">  3864</span>	then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the
<span id="L3865" class="ln">  3865</span>	missing lads had promised that the village should &#34;hear something&#34;
<span id="L3866" class="ln">  3866</span>	soon; the wise-heads had &#34;put this and that together&#34; and decided that
<span id="L3867" class="ln">  3867</span>	the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town
<span id="L3868" class="ln">  3868</span>	below, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged
<span id="L3869" class="ln">  3869</span>	against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village
<span id="L3870" class="ln">  3870</span>	--and then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have
<span id="L3871" class="ln">  3871</span>	driven them home by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the
<span id="L3872" class="ln">  3872</span>	search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the
<span id="L3873" class="ln">  3873</span>	drowning must have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good
<span id="L3874" class="ln">  3874</span>	swimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday
<span id="L3875" class="ln">  3875</span>	night. If the bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be
<span id="L3876" class="ln">  3876</span>	given over, and the funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom
<span id="L3877" class="ln">  3877</span>	shuddered.
<span id="L3878" class="ln">  3878</span>	
<span id="L3879" class="ln">  3879</span>	Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go. Then with a
<span id="L3880" class="ln">  3880</span>	mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each
<span id="L3881" class="ln">  3881</span>	other&#39;s arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly
<span id="L3882" class="ln">  3882</span>	was tender far beyond her wont, in her good-night to Sid and Mary. Sid
<span id="L3883" class="ln">  3883</span>	snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.
<span id="L3884" class="ln">  3884</span>	
<span id="L3885" class="ln">  3885</span>	Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so
<span id="L3886" class="ln">  3886</span>	appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her old
<span id="L3887" class="ln">  3887</span>	trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long before she
<span id="L3888" class="ln">  3888</span>	was through.
<span id="L3889" class="ln">  3889</span>	
<span id="L3890" class="ln">  3890</span>	He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
<span id="L3891" class="ln">  3891</span>	broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
<span id="L3892" class="ln">  3892</span>	turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her
<span id="L3893" class="ln">  3893</span>	sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the
<span id="L3894" class="ln">  3894</span>	candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full
<span id="L3895" class="ln">  3895</span>	of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
<span id="L3896" class="ln">  3896</span>	candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His
<span id="L3897" class="ln">  3897</span>	face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
<span id="L3898" class="ln">  3898</span>	hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and
<span id="L3899" class="ln">  3899</span>	straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.
<span id="L3900" class="ln">  3900</span>	
<span id="L3901" class="ln">  3901</span>	He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
<span id="L3902" class="ln">  3902</span>	there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was
<span id="L3903" class="ln">  3903</span>	tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and
<span id="L3904" class="ln">  3904</span>	slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped
<span id="L3905" class="ln">  3905</span>	into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a
<span id="L3906" class="ln">  3906</span>	mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself
<span id="L3907" class="ln">  3907</span>	stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for
<span id="L3908" class="ln">  3908</span>	this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture the
<span id="L3909" class="ln">  3909</span>	skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
<span id="L3910" class="ln">  3910</span>	legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be
<span id="L3911" class="ln">  3911</span>	made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and
<span id="L3912" class="ln">  3912</span>	entered the woods.
<span id="L3913" class="ln">  3913</span>	
<span id="L3914" class="ln">  3914</span>	He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
<span id="L3915" class="ln">  3915</span>	awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far
<span id="L3916" class="ln">  3916</span>	spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
<span id="L3917" class="ln">  3917</span>	island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
<span id="L3918" class="ln">  3918</span>	great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A
<span id="L3919" class="ln">  3919</span>	little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and
<span id="L3920" class="ln">  3920</span>	heard Joe say:
<span id="L3921" class="ln">  3921</span>	
<span id="L3922" class="ln">  3922</span>	&#34;No, Tom&#39;s true-blue, Huck, and he&#39;ll come back. He won&#39;t desert. He
<span id="L3923" class="ln">  3923</span>	knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom&#39;s too proud for
<span id="L3924" class="ln">  3924</span>	that sort of thing. He&#39;s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?&#34;
<span id="L3925" class="ln">  3925</span>	
<span id="L3926" class="ln">  3926</span>	&#34;Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain&#39;t they?&#34;
<span id="L3927" class="ln">  3927</span>	
<span id="L3928" class="ln">  3928</span>	&#34;Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain&#39;t
<span id="L3929" class="ln">  3929</span>	back here to breakfast.&#34;
<span id="L3930" class="ln">  3930</span>	
<span id="L3931" class="ln">  3931</span>	&#34;Which he is!&#34; exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping
<span id="L3932" class="ln">  3932</span>	grandly into camp.
<span id="L3933" class="ln">  3933</span>	
<span id="L3934" class="ln">  3934</span>	A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as
<span id="L3935" class="ln">  3935</span>	the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his
<span id="L3936" class="ln">  3936</span>	adventures. They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the
<span id="L3937" class="ln">  3937</span>	tale was done. Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till
<span id="L3938" class="ln">  3938</span>	noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore.
<span id="L3939" class="ln">  3939</span>	
<span id="L3940" class="ln">  3940</span>

<span id="L3942" class="ln">  3942</span>	CHAPTER XVI
<span id="L3943" class="ln">  3943</span>	
<span id="L3944" class="ln">  3944</span>	AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the
<span id="L3945" class="ln">  3945</span>	bar. They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a
<span id="L3946" class="ln">  3946</span>	soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands.
<span id="L3947" class="ln">  3947</span>	Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They
<span id="L3948" class="ln">  3948</span>	were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English
<span id="L3949" class="ln">  3949</span>	walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on
<span id="L3950" class="ln">  3950</span>	Friday morning.
<span id="L3951" class="ln">  3951</span>	
<span id="L3952" class="ln">  3952</span>	After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and
<span id="L3953" class="ln">  3953</span>	chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until
<span id="L3954" class="ln">  3954</span>	they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
<span id="L3955" class="ln">  3955</span>	water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their
<span id="L3956" class="ln">  3956</span>	legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.
<span id="L3957" class="ln">  3957</span>	And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
<span id="L3958" class="ln">  3958</span>	other&#39;s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with
<span id="L3959" class="ln">  3959</span>	averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and
<span id="L3960" class="ln">  3960</span>	struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all
<span id="L3961" class="ln">  3961</span>	went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,
<span id="L3962" class="ln">  3962</span>	sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
<span id="L3963" class="ln">  3963</span>	
<span id="L3964" class="ln">  3964</span>	When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the
<span id="L3965" class="ln">  3965</span>	dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by
<span id="L3966" class="ln">  3966</span>	and by break for the water again and go through the original
<span id="L3967" class="ln">  3967</span>	performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked
<span id="L3968" class="ln">  3968</span>	skin represented flesh-colored &#34;tights&#34; very fairly; so they drew a
<span id="L3969" class="ln">  3969</span>	ring in the sand and had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none
<span id="L3970" class="ln">  3970</span>	would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.
<span id="L3971" class="ln">  3971</span>	
<span id="L3972" class="ln">  3972</span>	Next they got their marbles and played &#34;knucks&#34; and &#34;ring-taw&#34; and
<span id="L3973" class="ln">  3973</span>	&#34;keeps&#34; till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another
<span id="L3974" class="ln">  3974</span>	swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off
<span id="L3975" class="ln">  3975</span>	his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
<span id="L3976" class="ln">  3976</span>	ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
<span id="L3977" class="ln">  3977</span>	protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he
<span id="L3978" class="ln">  3978</span>	had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
<span id="L3979" class="ln">  3979</span>	rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the &#34;dumps,&#34; and fell
<span id="L3980" class="ln">  3980</span>	to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
<span id="L3981" class="ln">  3981</span>	drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing &#34;BECKY&#34; in the sand with
<span id="L3982" class="ln">  3982</span>	his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his
<span id="L3983" class="ln">  3983</span>	weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He
<span id="L3984" class="ln">  3984</span>	erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving
<span id="L3985" class="ln">  3985</span>	the other boys together and joining them.
<span id="L3986" class="ln">  3986</span>	
<span id="L3987" class="ln">  3987</span>	But Joe&#39;s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so
<span id="L3988" class="ln">  3988</span>	homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay
<span id="L3989" class="ln">  3989</span>	very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,
<span id="L3990" class="ln">  3990</span>	but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready
<span id="L3991" class="ln">  3991</span>	to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon,
<span id="L3992" class="ln">  3992</span>	he would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of
<span id="L3993" class="ln">  3993</span>	cheerfulness:
<span id="L3994" class="ln">  3994</span>	
<span id="L3995" class="ln">  3995</span>	&#34;I bet there&#39;s been pirates on this island before, boys. We&#39;ll explore
<span id="L3996" class="ln">  3996</span>	it again. They&#39;ve hid treasures here somewhere. How&#39;d you feel to light
<span id="L3997" class="ln">  3997</span>	on a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?&#34;
<span id="L3998" class="ln">  3998</span>	
<span id="L3999" class="ln">  3999</span>	But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.
<span id="L4000" class="ln">  4000</span>	Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was
<span id="L4001" class="ln">  4001</span>	discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
<span id="L4002" class="ln">  4002</span>	very gloomy. Finally he said:
<span id="L4003" class="ln">  4003</span>	
<span id="L4004" class="ln">  4004</span>	&#34;Oh, boys, let&#39;s give it up. I want to go home. It&#39;s so lonesome.&#34;
<span id="L4005" class="ln">  4005</span>	
<span id="L4006" class="ln">  4006</span>	&#34;Oh no, Joe, you&#39;ll feel better by and by,&#34; said Tom. &#34;Just think of
<span id="L4007" class="ln">  4007</span>	the fishing that&#39;s here.&#34;
<span id="L4008" class="ln">  4008</span>	
<span id="L4009" class="ln">  4009</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t care for fishing. I want to go home.&#34;
<span id="L4010" class="ln">  4010</span>	
<span id="L4011" class="ln">  4011</span>	&#34;But, Joe, there ain&#39;t such another swimming-place anywhere.&#34;
<span id="L4012" class="ln">  4012</span>	
<span id="L4013" class="ln">  4013</span>	&#34;Swimming&#39;s no good. I don&#39;t seem to care for it, somehow, when there
<span id="L4014" class="ln">  4014</span>	ain&#39;t anybody to say I sha&#39;n&#39;t go in. I mean to go home.&#34;
<span id="L4015" class="ln">  4015</span>	
<span id="L4016" class="ln">  4016</span>	&#34;Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.&#34;
<span id="L4017" class="ln">  4017</span>	
<span id="L4018" class="ln">  4018</span>	&#34;Yes, I DO want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one.
<span id="L4019" class="ln">  4019</span>	I ain&#39;t any more baby than you are.&#34; And Joe snuffled a little.
<span id="L4020" class="ln">  4020</span>	
<span id="L4021" class="ln">  4021</span>	&#34;Well, we&#39;ll let the cry-baby go home to his mother, won&#39;t we, Huck?
<span id="L4022" class="ln">  4022</span>	Poor thing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like
<span id="L4023" class="ln">  4023</span>	it here, don&#39;t you, Huck? We&#39;ll stay, won&#39;t we?&#34;
<span id="L4024" class="ln">  4024</span>	
<span id="L4025" class="ln">  4025</span>	Huck said, &#34;Y-e-s&#34;--without any heart in it.
<span id="L4026" class="ln">  4026</span>	
<span id="L4027" class="ln">  4027</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll never speak to you again as long as I live,&#34; said Joe, rising.
<span id="L4028" class="ln">  4028</span>	&#34;There now!&#34; And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.
<span id="L4029" class="ln">  4029</span>	
<span id="L4030" class="ln">  4030</span>	&#34;Who cares!&#34; said Tom. &#34;Nobody wants you to. Go &#39;long home and get
<span id="L4031" class="ln">  4031</span>	laughed at. Oh, you&#39;re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain&#39;t cry-babies.
<span id="L4032" class="ln">  4032</span>	We&#39;ll stay, won&#39;t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can
<span id="L4033" class="ln">  4033</span>	get along without him, per&#39;aps.&#34;
<span id="L4034" class="ln">  4034</span>	
<span id="L4035" class="ln">  4035</span>	But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go
<span id="L4036" class="ln">  4036</span>	sullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see
<span id="L4037" class="ln">  4037</span>	Huck eying Joe&#39;s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an
<span id="L4038" class="ln">  4038</span>	ominous silence. Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade
<span id="L4039" class="ln">  4039</span>	off toward the Illinois shore. Tom&#39;s heart began to sink. He glanced at
<span id="L4040" class="ln">  4040</span>	Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:
<span id="L4041" class="ln">  4041</span>	
<span id="L4042" class="ln">  4042</span>	&#34;I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now
<span id="L4043" class="ln">  4043</span>	it&#39;ll be worse. Let&#39;s us go, too, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L4044" class="ln">  4044</span>	
<span id="L4045" class="ln">  4045</span>	&#34;I won&#39;t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.&#34;
<span id="L4046" class="ln">  4046</span>	
<span id="L4047" class="ln">  4047</span>	&#34;Tom, I better go.&#34;
<span id="L4048" class="ln">  4048</span>	
<span id="L4049" class="ln">  4049</span>	&#34;Well, go &#39;long--who&#39;s hendering you.&#34;
<span id="L4050" class="ln">  4050</span>	
<span id="L4051" class="ln">  4051</span>	Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:
<span id="L4052" class="ln">  4052</span>	
<span id="L4053" class="ln">  4053</span>	&#34;Tom, I wisht you&#39;d come, too. Now you think it over. We&#39;ll wait for
<span id="L4054" class="ln">  4054</span>	you when we get to shore.&#34;
<span id="L4055" class="ln">  4055</span>	
<span id="L4056" class="ln">  4056</span>	&#34;Well, you&#39;ll wait a blame long time, that&#39;s all.&#34;
<span id="L4057" class="ln">  4057</span>	
<span id="L4058" class="ln">  4058</span>	Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a
<span id="L4059" class="ln">  4059</span>	strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too.
<span id="L4060" class="ln">  4060</span>	He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It
<span id="L4061" class="ln">  4061</span>	suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He
<span id="L4062" class="ln">  4062</span>	made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his
<span id="L4063" class="ln">  4063</span>	comrades, yelling:
<span id="L4064" class="ln">  4064</span>	
<span id="L4065" class="ln">  4065</span>	&#34;Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!&#34;
<span id="L4066" class="ln">  4066</span>	
<span id="L4067" class="ln">  4067</span>	They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they
<span id="L4068" class="ln">  4068</span>	were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at
<span id="L4069" class="ln">  4069</span>	last they saw the &#34;point&#34; he was driving at, and then they set up a
<span id="L4070" class="ln">  4070</span>	war-whoop of applause and said it was &#34;splendid!&#34; and said if he had
<span id="L4071" class="ln">  4071</span>	told them at first, they wouldn&#39;t have started away. He made a plausible
<span id="L4072" class="ln">  4072</span>	excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
<span id="L4073" class="ln">  4073</span>	would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had
<span id="L4074" class="ln">  4074</span>	meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.
<span id="L4075" class="ln">  4075</span>	
<span id="L4076" class="ln">  4076</span>	The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,
<span id="L4077" class="ln">  4077</span>	chattering all the time about Tom&#39;s stupendous plan and admiring the
<span id="L4078" class="ln">  4078</span>	genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to
<span id="L4079" class="ln">  4079</span>	learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
<span id="L4080" class="ln">  4080</span>	try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never
<span id="L4081" class="ln">  4081</span>	smoked anything before but cigars made of grape-vine, and they &#34;bit&#34;
<span id="L4082" class="ln">  4082</span>	the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.
<span id="L4083" class="ln">  4083</span>	
<span id="L4084" class="ln">  4084</span>	Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
<span id="L4085" class="ln">  4085</span>	charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant
<span id="L4086" class="ln">  4086</span>	taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:
<span id="L4087" class="ln">  4087</span>	
<span id="L4088" class="ln">  4088</span>	&#34;Why, it&#39;s just as easy! If I&#39;d a knowed this was all, I&#39;d a learnt
<span id="L4089" class="ln">  4089</span>	long ago.&#34;
<span id="L4090" class="ln">  4090</span>	
<span id="L4091" class="ln">  4091</span>	&#34;So would I,&#34; said Joe. &#34;It&#39;s just nothing.&#34;
<span id="L4092" class="ln">  4092</span>	
<span id="L4093" class="ln">  4093</span>	&#34;Why, many a time I&#39;ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I
<span id="L4094" class="ln">  4094</span>	wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,&#34; said Tom.
<span id="L4095" class="ln">  4095</span>	
<span id="L4096" class="ln">  4096</span>	&#34;That&#39;s just the way with me, hain&#39;t it, Huck? You&#39;ve heard me talk
<span id="L4097" class="ln">  4097</span>	just that way--haven&#39;t you, Huck? I&#39;ll leave it to Huck if I haven&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L4098" class="ln">  4098</span>	
<span id="L4099" class="ln">  4099</span>	&#34;Yes--heaps of times,&#34; said Huck.
<span id="L4100" class="ln">  4100</span>	
<span id="L4101" class="ln">  4101</span>	&#34;Well, I have too,&#34; said Tom; &#34;oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the
<span id="L4102" class="ln">  4102</span>	slaughter-house. Don&#39;t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and
<span id="L4103" class="ln">  4103</span>	Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don&#39;t you remember,
<span id="L4104" class="ln">  4104</span>	Huck, &#39;bout me saying that?&#34;
<span id="L4105" class="ln">  4105</span>	
<span id="L4106" class="ln">  4106</span>	&#34;Yes, that&#39;s so,&#34; said Huck. &#34;That was the day after I lost a white
<span id="L4107" class="ln">  4107</span>	alley. No, &#39;twas the day before.&#34;
<span id="L4108" class="ln">  4108</span>	
<span id="L4109" class="ln">  4109</span>	&#34;There--I told you so,&#34; said Tom. &#34;Huck recollects it.&#34;
<span id="L4110" class="ln">  4110</span>	
<span id="L4111" class="ln">  4111</span>	&#34;I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,&#34; said Joe. &#34;I don&#39;t feel
<span id="L4112" class="ln">  4112</span>	sick.&#34;
<span id="L4113" class="ln">  4113</span>	
<span id="L4114" class="ln">  4114</span>	&#34;Neither do I,&#34; said Tom. &#34;I could smoke it all day. But I bet you
<span id="L4115" class="ln">  4115</span>	Jeff Thatcher couldn&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L4116" class="ln">  4116</span>	
<span id="L4117" class="ln">  4117</span>	&#34;Jeff Thatcher! Why, he&#39;d keel over just with two draws. Just let him
<span id="L4118" class="ln">  4118</span>	try it once. HE&#39;D see!&#34;
<span id="L4119" class="ln">  4119</span>	
<span id="L4120" class="ln">  4120</span>	&#34;I bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller
<span id="L4121" class="ln">  4121</span>	tackle it once.&#34;
<span id="L4122" class="ln">  4122</span>	
<span id="L4123" class="ln">  4123</span>	&#34;Oh, don&#39;t I!&#34; said Joe. &#34;Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn&#39;t any
<span id="L4124" class="ln">  4124</span>	more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch HIM.&#34;
<span id="L4125" class="ln">  4125</span>	
<span id="L4126" class="ln">  4126</span>	&#34;&#39;Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.&#34;
<span id="L4127" class="ln">  4127</span>	
<span id="L4128" class="ln">  4128</span>	&#34;So do I.&#34;
<span id="L4129" class="ln">  4129</span>	
<span id="L4130" class="ln">  4130</span>	&#34;Say--boys, don&#39;t say anything about it, and some time when they&#39;re
<span id="L4131" class="ln">  4131</span>	around, I&#39;ll come up to you and say, &#39;Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.&#39;
<span id="L4132" class="ln">  4132</span>	And you&#39;ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn&#39;t anything, you&#39;ll
<span id="L4133" class="ln">  4133</span>	say, &#39;Yes, I got my OLD pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain&#39;t
<span id="L4134" class="ln">  4134</span>	very good.&#39; And I&#39;ll say, &#39;Oh, that&#39;s all right, if it&#39;s STRONG
<span id="L4135" class="ln">  4135</span>	enough.&#39; And then you&#39;ll out with the pipes, and we&#39;ll light up just as
<span id="L4136" class="ln">  4136</span>	ca&#39;m, and then just see &#39;em look!&#34;
<span id="L4137" class="ln">  4137</span>	
<span id="L4138" class="ln">  4138</span>	&#34;By jings, that&#39;ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was NOW!&#34;
<span id="L4139" class="ln">  4139</span>	
<span id="L4140" class="ln">  4140</span>	&#34;So do I! And when we tell &#39;em we learned when we was off pirating,
<span id="L4141" class="ln">  4141</span>	won&#39;t they wish they&#39;d been along?&#34;
<span id="L4142" class="ln">  4142</span>	
<span id="L4143" class="ln">  4143</span>	&#34;Oh, I reckon not! I&#39;ll just BET they will!&#34;
<span id="L4144" class="ln">  4144</span>	
<span id="L4145" class="ln">  4145</span>	So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow
<span id="L4146" class="ln">  4146</span>	disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously
<span id="L4147" class="ln">  4147</span>	increased. Every pore inside the boys&#39; cheeks became a spouting
<span id="L4148" class="ln">  4148</span>	fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
<span id="L4149" class="ln">  4149</span>	fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their
<span id="L4150" class="ln">  4150</span>	throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings
<span id="L4151" class="ln">  4151</span>	followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,
<span id="L4152" class="ln">  4152</span>	now. Joe&#39;s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom&#39;s followed.
<span id="L4153" class="ln">  4153</span>	Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might
<span id="L4154" class="ln">  4154</span>	and main. Joe said feebly:
<span id="L4155" class="ln">  4155</span>	
<span id="L4156" class="ln">  4156</span>	&#34;I&#39;ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.&#34;
<span id="L4157" class="ln">  4157</span>	
<span id="L4158" class="ln">  4158</span>	Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:
<span id="L4159" class="ln">  4159</span>	
<span id="L4160" class="ln">  4160</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll help you. You go over that way and I&#39;ll hunt around by the
<span id="L4161" class="ln">  4161</span>	spring. No, you needn&#39;t come, Huck--we can find it.&#34;
<span id="L4162" class="ln">  4162</span>	
<span id="L4163" class="ln">  4163</span>	So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,
<span id="L4164" class="ln">  4164</span>	and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both
<span id="L4165" class="ln">  4165</span>	very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they
<span id="L4166" class="ln">  4166</span>	had had any trouble they had got rid of it.
<span id="L4167" class="ln">  4167</span>	
<span id="L4168" class="ln">  4168</span>	They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,
<span id="L4169" class="ln">  4169</span>	and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
<span id="L4170" class="ln">  4170</span>	theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they
<span id="L4171" class="ln">  4171</span>	ate at dinner had disagreed with them.
<span id="L4172" class="ln">  4172</span>	
<span id="L4173" class="ln">  4173</span>	About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding
<span id="L4174" class="ln">  4174</span>	oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys
<span id="L4175" class="ln">  4175</span>	huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of
<span id="L4176" class="ln">  4176</span>	the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was
<span id="L4177" class="ln">  4177</span>	stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush
<span id="L4178" class="ln">  4178</span>	continued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in
<span id="L4179" class="ln">  4179</span>	the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that
<span id="L4180" class="ln">  4180</span>	vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by
<span id="L4181" class="ln">  4181</span>	another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came
<span id="L4182" class="ln">  4182</span>	sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
<span id="L4183" class="ln">  4183</span>	breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit
<span id="L4184" class="ln">  4184</span>	of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned
<span id="L4185" class="ln">  4185</span>	night into day and showed every little grass-blade, separate and
<span id="L4186" class="ln">  4186</span>	distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,
<span id="L4187" class="ln">  4187</span>	startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
<span id="L4188" class="ln">  4188</span>	down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A
<span id="L4189" class="ln">  4189</span>	sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the
<span id="L4190" class="ln">  4190</span>	flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the
<span id="L4191" class="ln">  4191</span>	forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops
<span id="L4192" class="ln">  4192</span>	right over the boys&#39; heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick
<span id="L4193" class="ln">  4193</span>	gloom that followed. A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the
<span id="L4194" class="ln">  4194</span>	leaves.
<span id="L4195" class="ln">  4195</span>	
<span id="L4196" class="ln">  4196</span>	&#34;Quick! boys, go for the tent!&#34; exclaimed Tom.
<span id="L4197" class="ln">  4197</span>	
<span id="L4198" class="ln">  4198</span>	They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no
<span id="L4199" class="ln">  4199</span>	two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the
<span id="L4200" class="ln">  4200</span>	trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after
<span id="L4201" class="ln">  4201</span>	another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a
<span id="L4202" class="ln">  4202</span>	drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets
<span id="L4203" class="ln">  4203</span>	along the ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring
<span id="L4204" class="ln">  4204</span>	wind and the booming thunder-blasts drowned their voices utterly.
<span id="L4205" class="ln">  4205</span>	However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under
<span id="L4206" class="ln">  4206</span>	the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company
<span id="L4207" class="ln">  4207</span>	in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the
<span id="L4208" class="ln">  4208</span>	old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have
<span id="L4209" class="ln">  4209</span>	allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the
<span id="L4210" class="ln">  4210</span>	sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast.
<span id="L4211" class="ln">  4211</span>	The boys seized each others&#39; hands and fled, with many tumblings and
<span id="L4212" class="ln">  4212</span>	bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank.
<span id="L4213" class="ln">  4213</span>	Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of
<span id="L4214" class="ln">  4214</span>	lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in
<span id="L4215" class="ln">  4215</span>	clean-cut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy
<span id="L4216" class="ln">  4216</span>	river, white with foam, the driving spray of spume-flakes, the dim
<span id="L4217" class="ln">  4217</span>	outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the
<span id="L4218" class="ln">  4218</span>	drifting cloud-rack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while
<span id="L4219" class="ln">  4219</span>	some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger
<span id="L4220" class="ln">  4220</span>	growth; and the unflagging thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting
<span id="L4221" class="ln">  4221</span>	explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm
<span id="L4222" class="ln">  4222</span>	culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island
<span id="L4223" class="ln">  4223</span>	to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the tree-tops, blow it away, and
<span id="L4224" class="ln">  4224</span>	deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a
<span id="L4225" class="ln">  4225</span>	wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.
<span id="L4226" class="ln">  4226</span>	
<span id="L4227" class="ln">  4227</span>	But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker
<span id="L4228" class="ln">  4228</span>	and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The
<span id="L4229" class="ln">  4229</span>	boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was
<span id="L4230" class="ln">  4230</span>	still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the
<span id="L4231" class="ln">  4231</span>	shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and
<span id="L4232" class="ln">  4232</span>	they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.
<span id="L4233" class="ln">  4233</span>	
<span id="L4234" class="ln">  4234</span>	Everything in camp was drenched, the camp-fire as well; for they were
<span id="L4235" class="ln">  4235</span>	but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision
<span id="L4236" class="ln">  4236</span>	against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through
<span id="L4237" class="ln">  4237</span>	and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently
<span id="L4238" class="ln">  4238</span>	discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
<span id="L4239" class="ln">  4239</span>	been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from
<span id="L4240" class="ln">  4240</span>	the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so
<span id="L4241" class="ln">  4241</span>	they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the
<span id="L4242" class="ln">  4242</span>	under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then
<span id="L4243" class="ln">  4243</span>	they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and
<span id="L4244" class="ln">  4244</span>	were glad-hearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a
<span id="L4245" class="ln">  4245</span>	feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified
<span id="L4246" class="ln">  4246</span>	their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to
<span id="L4247" class="ln">  4247</span>	sleep on, anywhere around.
<span id="L4248" class="ln">  4248</span>	
<span id="L4249" class="ln">  4249</span>	As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them,
<span id="L4250" class="ln">  4250</span>	and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got
<span id="L4251" class="ln">  4251</span>	scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After
<span id="L4252" class="ln">  4252</span>	the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once
<span id="L4253" class="ln">  4253</span>	more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as
<span id="L4254" class="ln">  4254</span>	he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming,
<span id="L4255" class="ln">  4255</span>	or anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray
<span id="L4256" class="ln">  4256</span>	of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This
<span id="L4257" class="ln">  4257</span>	was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a
<span id="L4258" class="ln">  4258</span>	change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before
<span id="L4259" class="ln">  4259</span>	they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like
<span id="L4260" class="ln">  4260</span>	so many zebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went
<span id="L4261" class="ln">  4261</span>	tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.
<span id="L4262" class="ln">  4262</span>	
<span id="L4263" class="ln">  4263</span>	By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon
<span id="L4264" class="ln">  4264</span>	each other from ambush with dreadful war-whoops, and killed and scalped
<span id="L4265" class="ln">  4265</span>	each other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an
<span id="L4266" class="ln">  4266</span>	extremely satisfactory one.
<span id="L4267" class="ln">  4267</span>	
<span id="L4268" class="ln">  4268</span>	They assembled in camp toward supper-time, hungry and happy; but now a
<span id="L4269" class="ln">  4269</span>	difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of
<span id="L4270" class="ln">  4270</span>	hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple
<span id="L4271" class="ln">  4271</span>	impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other
<span id="L4272" class="ln">  4272</span>	process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished
<span id="L4273" class="ln">  4273</span>	they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with
<span id="L4274" class="ln">  4274</span>	such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe
<span id="L4275" class="ln">  4275</span>	and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.
<span id="L4276" class="ln">  4276</span>	
<span id="L4277" class="ln">  4277</span>	And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had
<span id="L4278" class="ln">  4278</span>	gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without
<span id="L4279" class="ln">  4279</span>	having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to
<span id="L4280" class="ln">  4280</span>	be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high
<span id="L4281" class="ln">  4281</span>	promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after
<span id="L4282" class="ln">  4282</span>	supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening.
<span id="L4283" class="ln">  4283</span>	They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would
<span id="L4284" class="ln">  4284</span>	have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will
<span id="L4285" class="ln">  4285</span>	leave them to smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use
<span id="L4286" class="ln">  4286</span>	for them at present.
<span id="L4287" class="ln">  4287</span>	
<span id="L4288" class="ln">  4288</span>	
<span id="L4289" class="ln">  4289</span>	
<span id="L4290" class="ln">  4290</span>	CHAPTER XVII
<span id="L4291" class="ln">  4291</span>	
<span id="L4292" class="ln">  4292</span>	BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil
<span id="L4293" class="ln">  4293</span>	Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly&#39;s family, were being
<span id="L4294" class="ln">  4294</span>	put into mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet
<span id="L4295" class="ln">  4295</span>	possessed the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all
<span id="L4296" class="ln">  4296</span>	conscience. The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air,
<span id="L4297" class="ln">  4297</span>	and talked little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a
<span id="L4298" class="ln">  4298</span>	burden to the children. They had no heart in their sports, and
<span id="L4299" class="ln">  4299</span>	gradually gave them up.
<span id="L4300" class="ln">  4300</span>	
<span id="L4301" class="ln">  4301</span>	In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the
<span id="L4302" class="ln">  4302</span>	deserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found
<span id="L4303" class="ln">  4303</span>	nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:
<span id="L4304" class="ln">  4304</span>	
<span id="L4305" class="ln">  4305</span>	&#34;Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven&#39;t got
<span id="L4306" class="ln">  4306</span>	anything now to remember him by.&#34; And she choked back a little sob.
<span id="L4307" class="ln">  4307</span>	
<span id="L4308" class="ln">  4308</span>	Presently she stopped, and said to herself:
<span id="L4309" class="ln">  4309</span>	
<span id="L4310" class="ln">  4310</span>	&#34;It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn&#39;t say
<span id="L4311" class="ln">  4311</span>	that--I wouldn&#39;t say it for the whole world. But he&#39;s gone now; I&#39;ll
<span id="L4312" class="ln">  4312</span>	never, never, never see him any more.&#34;
<span id="L4313" class="ln">  4313</span>	
<span id="L4314" class="ln">  4314</span>	This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling
<span id="L4315" class="ln">  4315</span>	down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls--playmates of
<span id="L4316" class="ln">  4316</span>	Tom&#39;s and Joe&#39;s--came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and
<span id="L4317" class="ln">  4317</span>	talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they
<span id="L4318" class="ln">  4318</span>	saw him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with
<span id="L4319" class="ln">  4319</span>	awful prophecy, as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker
<span id="L4320" class="ln">  4320</span>	pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and
<span id="L4321" class="ln">  4321</span>	then added something like &#34;and I was a-standing just so--just as I am
<span id="L4322" class="ln">  4322</span>	now, and as if you was him--I was as close as that--and he smiled, just
<span id="L4323" class="ln">  4323</span>	this way--and then something seemed to go all over me, like--awful, you
<span id="L4324" class="ln">  4324</span>	know--and I never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!&#34;
<span id="L4325" class="ln">  4325</span>	
<span id="L4326" class="ln">  4326</span>	Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and
<span id="L4327" class="ln">  4327</span>	many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or
<span id="L4328" class="ln">  4328</span>	less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided
<span id="L4329" class="ln">  4329</span>	who DID see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,
<span id="L4330" class="ln">  4330</span>	the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and
<span id="L4331" class="ln">  4331</span>	were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had no
<span id="L4332" class="ln">  4332</span>	other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
<span id="L4333" class="ln">  4333</span>	remembrance:
<span id="L4334" class="ln">  4334</span>	
<span id="L4335" class="ln">  4335</span>	&#34;Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.&#34;
<span id="L4336" class="ln">  4336</span>	
<span id="L4337" class="ln">  4337</span>	But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,
<span id="L4338" class="ln">  4338</span>	and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered
<span id="L4339" class="ln">  4339</span>	away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.
<span id="L4340" class="ln">  4340</span>	
<span id="L4341" class="ln">  4341</span>	When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
<span id="L4342" class="ln">  4342</span>	began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still
<span id="L4343" class="ln">  4343</span>	Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
<span id="L4344" class="ln">  4344</span>	that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
<span id="L4345" class="ln">  4345</span>	in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there
<span id="L4346" class="ln">  4346</span>	was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses
<span id="L4347" class="ln">  4347</span>	as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None
<span id="L4348" class="ln">  4348</span>	could remember when the little church had been so full before. There
<span id="L4349" class="ln">  4349</span>	was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly
<span id="L4350" class="ln">  4350</span>	entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all
<span id="L4351" class="ln">  4351</span>	in deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well,
<span id="L4352" class="ln">  4352</span>	rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front
<span id="L4353" class="ln">  4353</span>	pew. There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by
<span id="L4354" class="ln">  4354</span>	muffled sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed.
<span id="L4355" class="ln">  4355</span>	A moving hymn was sung, and the text followed: &#34;I am the Resurrection
<span id="L4356" class="ln">  4356</span>	and the Life.&#34;
<span id="L4357" class="ln">  4357</span>	
<span id="L4358" class="ln">  4358</span>	As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
<span id="L4359" class="ln">  4359</span>	graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that
<span id="L4360" class="ln">  4360</span>	every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in
<span id="L4361" class="ln">  4361</span>	remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
<span id="L4362" class="ln">  4362</span>	before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
<span id="L4363" class="ln">  4363</span>	boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
<span id="L4364" class="ln">  4364</span>	departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the
<span id="L4365" class="ln">  4365</span>	people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes
<span id="L4366" class="ln">  4366</span>	were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
<span id="L4367" class="ln">  4367</span>	seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The
<span id="L4368" class="ln">  4368</span>	congregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on,
<span id="L4369" class="ln">  4369</span>	till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping
<span id="L4370" class="ln">  4370</span>	mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way
<span id="L4371" class="ln">  4371</span>	to his feelings, and crying in the pulpit.
<span id="L4372" class="ln">  4372</span>	
<span id="L4373" class="ln">  4373</span>	There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment
<span id="L4374" class="ln">  4374</span>	later the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes
<span id="L4375" class="ln">  4375</span>	above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then
<span id="L4376" class="ln">  4376</span>	another pair of eyes followed the minister&#39;s, and then almost with one
<span id="L4377" class="ln">  4377</span>	impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came
<span id="L4378" class="ln">  4378</span>	marching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of
<span id="L4379" class="ln">  4379</span>	drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in
<span id="L4380" class="ln">  4380</span>	the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!
<span id="L4381" class="ln">  4381</span>	
<span id="L4382" class="ln">  4382</span>	Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored
<span id="L4383" class="ln">  4383</span>	ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while
<span id="L4384" class="ln">  4384</span>	poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to
<span id="L4385" class="ln">  4385</span>	do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and
<span id="L4386" class="ln">  4386</span>	started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:
<span id="L4387" class="ln">  4387</span>	
<span id="L4388" class="ln">  4388</span>	&#34;Aunt Polly, it ain&#39;t fair. Somebody&#39;s got to be glad to see Huck.&#34;
<span id="L4389" class="ln">  4389</span>	
<span id="L4390" class="ln">  4390</span>	&#34;And so they shall. I&#39;m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!&#34; And
<span id="L4391" class="ln">  4391</span>	the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing
<span id="L4392" class="ln">  4392</span>	capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.
<span id="L4393" class="ln">  4393</span>	
<span id="L4394" class="ln">  4394</span>	Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: &#34;Praise God
<span id="L4395" class="ln">  4395</span>	from whom all blessings flow--SING!--and put your hearts in it!&#34;
<span id="L4396" class="ln">  4396</span>	
<span id="L4397" class="ln">  4397</span>	And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and
<span id="L4398" class="ln">  4398</span>	while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the
<span id="L4399" class="ln">  4399</span>	envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was
<span id="L4400" class="ln">  4400</span>	the proudest moment of his life.
<span id="L4401" class="ln">  4401</span>	
<span id="L4402" class="ln">  4402</span>	As the &#34;sold&#34; congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
<span id="L4403" class="ln">  4403</span>	willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
<span id="L4404" class="ln">  4404</span>	once more.
<span id="L4405" class="ln">  4405</span>	
<span id="L4406" class="ln">  4406</span>	Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to Aunt Polly&#39;s
<span id="L4407" class="ln">  4407</span>	varying moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew
<span id="L4408" class="ln">  4408</span>	which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.
<span id="L4409" class="ln">  4409</span>	
<span id="L4410" class="ln">  4410</span>	
<span id="L4411" class="ln">  4411</span>	
<span id="L4412" class="ln">  4412</span>	CHAPTER XVIII
<span id="L4413" class="ln">  4413</span>	
<span id="L4414" class="ln">  4414</span>	THAT was Tom&#39;s great secret--the scheme to return home with his
<span id="L4415" class="ln">  4415</span>	brother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to
<span id="L4416" class="ln">  4416</span>	the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six
<span id="L4417" class="ln">  4417</span>	miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the
<span id="L4418" class="ln">  4418</span>	town till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and
<span id="L4419" class="ln">  4419</span>	alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a
<span id="L4420" class="ln">  4420</span>	chaos of invalided benches.
<span id="L4421" class="ln">  4421</span>	
<span id="L4422" class="ln">  4422</span>	At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
<span id="L4423" class="ln">  4423</span>	Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of
<span id="L4424" class="ln">  4424</span>	talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:
<span id="L4425" class="ln">  4425</span>	
<span id="L4426" class="ln">  4426</span>	&#34;Well, I don&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
<span id="L4427" class="ln">  4427</span>	suffering &#39;most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity
<span id="L4428" class="ln">  4428</span>	you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come
<span id="L4429" class="ln">  4429</span>	over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give
<span id="L4430" class="ln">  4430</span>	me a hint some way that you warn&#39;t dead, but only run off.&#34;
<span id="L4431" class="ln">  4431</span>	
<span id="L4432" class="ln">  4432</span>	&#34;Yes, you could have done that, Tom,&#34; said Mary; &#34;and I believe you
<span id="L4433" class="ln">  4433</span>	would if you had thought of it.&#34;
<span id="L4434" class="ln">  4434</span>	
<span id="L4435" class="ln">  4435</span>	&#34;Would you, Tom?&#34; said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. &#34;Say,
<span id="L4436" class="ln">  4436</span>	now, would you, if you&#39;d thought of it?&#34;
<span id="L4437" class="ln">  4437</span>	
<span id="L4438" class="ln">  4438</span>	&#34;I--well, I don&#39;t know. &#39;Twould &#39;a&#39; spoiled everything.&#34;
<span id="L4439" class="ln">  4439</span>	
<span id="L4440" class="ln">  4440</span>	&#34;Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,&#34; said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
<span id="L4441" class="ln">  4441</span>	tone that discomforted the boy. &#34;It would have been something if you&#39;d
<span id="L4442" class="ln">  4442</span>	cared enough to THINK of it, even if you didn&#39;t DO it.&#34;
<span id="L4443" class="ln">  4443</span>	
<span id="L4444" class="ln">  4444</span>	&#34;Now, auntie, that ain&#39;t any harm,&#34; pleaded Mary; &#34;it&#39;s only Tom&#39;s
<span id="L4445" class="ln">  4445</span>	giddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of
<span id="L4446" class="ln">  4446</span>	anything.&#34;
<span id="L4447" class="ln">  4447</span>	
<span id="L4448" class="ln">  4448</span>	&#34;More&#39;s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and
<span id="L4449" class="ln">  4449</span>	DONE it, too. Tom, you&#39;ll look back, some day, when it&#39;s too late, and
<span id="L4450" class="ln">  4450</span>	wish you&#39;d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
<span id="L4451" class="ln">  4451</span>	little.&#34;
<span id="L4452" class="ln">  4452</span>	
<span id="L4453" class="ln">  4453</span>	&#34;Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,&#34; said Tom.
<span id="L4454" class="ln">  4454</span>	
<span id="L4455" class="ln">  4455</span>	&#34;I&#39;d know it better if you acted more like it.&#34;
<span id="L4456" class="ln">  4456</span>	
<span id="L4457" class="ln">  4457</span>	&#34;I wish now I&#39;d thought,&#34; said Tom, with a repentant tone; &#34;but I
<span id="L4458" class="ln">  4458</span>	dreamt about you, anyway. That&#39;s something, ain&#39;t it?&#34;
<span id="L4459" class="ln">  4459</span>	
<span id="L4460" class="ln">  4460</span>	&#34;It ain&#39;t much--a cat does that much--but it&#39;s better than nothing.
<span id="L4461" class="ln">  4461</span>	What did you dream?&#34;
<span id="L4462" class="ln">  4462</span>	
<span id="L4463" class="ln">  4463</span>	&#34;Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
<span id="L4464" class="ln">  4464</span>	bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.&#34;
<span id="L4465" class="ln">  4465</span>	
<span id="L4466" class="ln">  4466</span>	&#34;Well, so we did. So we always do. I&#39;m glad your dreams could take
<span id="L4467" class="ln">  4467</span>	even that much trouble about us.&#34;
<span id="L4468" class="ln">  4468</span>	
<span id="L4469" class="ln">  4469</span>	&#34;And I dreamt that Joe Harper&#39;s mother was here.&#34;
<span id="L4470" class="ln">  4470</span>	
<span id="L4471" class="ln">  4471</span>	&#34;Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?&#34;
<span id="L4472" class="ln">  4472</span>	
<span id="L4473" class="ln">  4473</span>	&#34;Oh, lots. But it&#39;s so dim, now.&#34;
<span id="L4474" class="ln">  4474</span>	
<span id="L4475" class="ln">  4475</span>	&#34;Well, try to recollect--can&#39;t you?&#34;
<span id="L4476" class="ln">  4476</span>	
<span id="L4477" class="ln">  4477</span>	&#34;Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--&#34;
<span id="L4478" class="ln">  4478</span>	
<span id="L4479" class="ln">  4479</span>	&#34;Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!&#34;
<span id="L4480" class="ln">  4480</span>	
<span id="L4481" class="ln">  4481</span>	Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
<span id="L4482" class="ln">  4482</span>	said:
<span id="L4483" class="ln">  4483</span>	
<span id="L4484" class="ln">  4484</span>	&#34;I&#39;ve got it now! I&#39;ve got it now! It blowed the candle!&#34;
<span id="L4485" class="ln">  4485</span>	
<span id="L4486" class="ln">  4486</span>	&#34;Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!&#34;
<span id="L4487" class="ln">  4487</span>	
<span id="L4488" class="ln">  4488</span>	&#34;And it seems to me that you said, &#39;Why, I believe that that door--&#39;&#34;
<span id="L4489" class="ln">  4489</span>	
<span id="L4490" class="ln">  4490</span>	&#34;Go ON, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L4491" class="ln">  4491</span>	
<span id="L4492" class="ln">  4492</span>	&#34;Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you
<span id="L4493" class="ln">  4493</span>	believed the door was open.&#34;
<span id="L4494" class="ln">  4494</span>	
<span id="L4495" class="ln">  4495</span>	&#34;As I&#39;m sitting here, I did! Didn&#39;t I, Mary! Go on!&#34;
<span id="L4496" class="ln">  4496</span>	
<span id="L4497" class="ln">  4497</span>	&#34;And then--and then--well I won&#39;t be certain, but it seems like as if
<span id="L4498" class="ln">  4498</span>	you made Sid go and--and--&#34;
<span id="L4499" class="ln">  4499</span>	
<span id="L4500" class="ln">  4500</span>	&#34;Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?&#34;
<span id="L4501" class="ln">  4501</span>	
<span id="L4502" class="ln">  4502</span>	&#34;You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.&#34;
<span id="L4503" class="ln">  4503</span>	
<span id="L4504" class="ln">  4504</span>	&#34;Well, for the land&#39;s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my
<span id="L4505" class="ln">  4505</span>	days! Don&#39;t tell ME there ain&#39;t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny
<span id="L4506" class="ln">  4506</span>	Harper shall know of this before I&#39;m an hour older. I&#39;d like to see her
<span id="L4507" class="ln">  4507</span>	get around THIS with her rubbage &#39;bout superstition. Go on, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L4508" class="ln">  4508</span>	
<span id="L4509" class="ln">  4509</span>	&#34;Oh, it&#39;s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I
<span id="L4510" class="ln">  4510</span>	warn&#39;t BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more
<span id="L4511" class="ln">  4511</span>	responsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.&#34;
<span id="L4512" class="ln">  4512</span>	
<span id="L4513" class="ln">  4513</span>	&#34;And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L4514" class="ln">  4514</span>	
<span id="L4515" class="ln">  4515</span>	&#34;And then you began to cry.&#34;
<span id="L4516" class="ln">  4516</span>	
<span id="L4517" class="ln">  4517</span>	&#34;So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--&#34;
<span id="L4518" class="ln">  4518</span>	
<span id="L4519" class="ln">  4519</span>	&#34;Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same,
<span id="L4520" class="ln">  4520</span>	and she wished she hadn&#39;t whipped him for taking cream when she&#39;d
<span id="L4521" class="ln">  4521</span>	throwed it out her own self--&#34;
<span id="L4522" class="ln">  4522</span>	
<span id="L4523" class="ln">  4523</span>	&#34;Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that&#39;s what you
<span id="L4524" class="ln">  4524</span>	was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L4525" class="ln">  4525</span>	
<span id="L4526" class="ln">  4526</span>	&#34;Then Sid he said--he said--&#34;
<span id="L4527" class="ln">  4527</span>	
<span id="L4528" class="ln">  4528</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t think I said anything,&#34; said Sid.
<span id="L4529" class="ln">  4529</span>	
<span id="L4530" class="ln">  4530</span>	&#34;Yes you did, Sid,&#34; said Mary.
<span id="L4531" class="ln">  4531</span>	
<span id="L4532" class="ln">  4532</span>	&#34;Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L4533" class="ln">  4533</span>	
<span id="L4534" class="ln">  4534</span>	&#34;He said--I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone
<span id="L4535" class="ln">  4535</span>	to, but if I&#39;d been better sometimes--&#34;
<span id="L4536" class="ln">  4536</span>	
<span id="L4537" class="ln">  4537</span>	&#34;THERE, d&#39;you hear that! It was his very words!&#34;
<span id="L4538" class="ln">  4538</span>	
<span id="L4539" class="ln">  4539</span>	&#34;And you shut him up sharp.&#34;
<span id="L4540" class="ln">  4540</span>	
<span id="L4541" class="ln">  4541</span>	&#34;I lay I did! There must &#39;a&#39; been an angel there. There WAS an angel
<span id="L4542" class="ln">  4542</span>	there, somewheres!&#34;
<span id="L4543" class="ln">  4543</span>	
<span id="L4544" class="ln">  4544</span>	&#34;And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and
<span id="L4545" class="ln">  4545</span>	you told about Peter and the Painkiller--&#34;
<span id="L4546" class="ln">  4546</span>	
<span id="L4547" class="ln">  4547</span>	&#34;Just as true as I live!&#34;
<span id="L4548" class="ln">  4548</span>	
<span id="L4549" class="ln">  4549</span>	&#34;And then there was a whole lot of talk &#39;bout dragging the river for
<span id="L4550" class="ln">  4550</span>	us, and &#39;bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss
<span id="L4551" class="ln">  4551</span>	Harper hugged and cried, and she went.&#34;
<span id="L4552" class="ln">  4552</span>	
<span id="L4553" class="ln">  4553</span>	&#34;It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I&#39;m a-sitting in
<span id="L4554" class="ln">  4554</span>	these very tracks. Tom, you couldn&#39;t told it more like if you&#39;d &#39;a&#39;
<span id="L4555" class="ln">  4555</span>	seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L4556" class="ln">  4556</span>	
<span id="L4557" class="ln">  4557</span>	&#34;Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every
<span id="L4558" class="ln">  4558</span>	word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and
<span id="L4559" class="ln">  4559</span>	wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, &#39;We ain&#39;t dead--we are only off
<span id="L4560" class="ln">  4560</span>	being pirates,&#39; and put it on the table by the candle; and then you
<span id="L4561" class="ln">  4561</span>	looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned
<span id="L4562" class="ln">  4562</span>	over and kissed you on the lips.&#34;
<span id="L4563" class="ln">  4563</span>	
<span id="L4564" class="ln">  4564</span>	&#34;Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for that!&#34; And
<span id="L4565" class="ln">  4565</span>	she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
<span id="L4566" class="ln">  4566</span>	guiltiest of villains.
<span id="L4567" class="ln">  4567</span>	
<span id="L4568" class="ln">  4568</span>	&#34;It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream,&#34; Sid soliloquized
<span id="L4569" class="ln">  4569</span>	just audibly.
<span id="L4570" class="ln">  4570</span>	
<span id="L4571" class="ln">  4571</span>	&#34;Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he&#39;d do if he
<span id="L4572" class="ln">  4572</span>	was awake. Here&#39;s a big Milum apple I&#39;ve been saving for you, Tom, if
<span id="L4573" class="ln">  4573</span>	you was ever found again--now go &#39;long to school. I&#39;m thankful to the
<span id="L4574" class="ln">  4574</span>	good God and Father of us all I&#39;ve got you back, that&#39;s long-suffering
<span id="L4575" class="ln">  4575</span>	and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though
<span id="L4576" class="ln">  4576</span>	goodness knows I&#39;m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His
<span id="L4577" class="ln">  4577</span>	blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there&#39;s
<span id="L4578" class="ln">  4578</span>	few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long
<span id="L4579" class="ln">  4579</span>	night comes. Go &#39;long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you&#39;ve
<span id="L4580" class="ln">  4580</span>	hendered me long enough.&#34;
<span id="L4581" class="ln">  4581</span>	
<span id="L4582" class="ln">  4582</span>	The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
<span id="L4583" class="ln">  4583</span>	and vanquish her realism with Tom&#39;s marvellous dream. Sid had better
<span id="L4584" class="ln">  4584</span>	judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
<span id="L4585" class="ln">  4585</span>	house. It was this: &#34;Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any
<span id="L4586" class="ln">  4586</span>	mistakes in it!&#34;
<span id="L4587" class="ln">  4587</span>	
<span id="L4588" class="ln">  4588</span>	What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,
<span id="L4589" class="ln">  4589</span>	but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
<span id="L4590" class="ln">  4590</span>	public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see
<span id="L4591" class="ln">  4591</span>	the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food
<span id="L4592" class="ln">  4592</span>	and drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as
<span id="L4593" class="ln">  4593</span>	proud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the
<span id="L4594" class="ln">  4594</span>	drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie
<span id="L4595" class="ln">  4595</span>	into town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away
<span id="L4596" class="ln">  4596</span>	at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would
<span id="L4597" class="ln">  4597</span>	have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his
<span id="L4598" class="ln">  4598</span>	glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
<span id="L4599" class="ln">  4599</span>	circus.
<span id="L4600" class="ln">  4600</span>	
<span id="L4601" class="ln">  4601</span>	At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered
<span id="L4602" class="ln">  4602</span>	such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not
<span id="L4603" class="ln">  4603</span>	long in becoming insufferably &#34;stuck-up.&#34; They began to tell their
<span id="L4604" class="ln">  4604</span>	adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing
<span id="L4605" class="ln">  4605</span>	likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish
<span id="L4606" class="ln">  4606</span>	material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely
<span id="L4607" class="ln">  4607</span>	puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.
<span id="L4608" class="ln">  4608</span>	
<span id="L4609" class="ln">  4609</span>	Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory
<span id="L4610" class="ln">  4610</span>	was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,
<span id="L4611" class="ln">  4611</span>	maybe she would be wanting to &#34;make up.&#34; Well, let her--she should see
<span id="L4612" class="ln">  4612</span>	that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she
<span id="L4613" class="ln">  4613</span>	arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group
<span id="L4614" class="ln">  4614</span>	of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was
<span id="L4615" class="ln">  4615</span>	tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,
<span id="L4616" class="ln">  4616</span>	pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter
<span id="L4617" class="ln">  4617</span>	when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her
<span id="L4618" class="ln">  4618</span>	captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
<span id="L4619" class="ln">  4619</span>	in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious
<span id="L4620" class="ln">  4620</span>	vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only &#34;set
<span id="L4621" class="ln">  4621</span>	him up&#34; the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that
<span id="L4622" class="ln">  4622</span>	he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
<span id="L4623" class="ln">  4623</span>	irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
<span id="L4624" class="ln">  4624</span>	wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
<span id="L4625" class="ln">  4625</span>	particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp
<span id="L4626" class="ln">  4626</span>	pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but
<span id="L4627" class="ln">  4627</span>	her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She
<span id="L4628" class="ln">  4628</span>	said to a girl almost at Tom&#39;s elbow--with sham vivacity:
<span id="L4629" class="ln">  4629</span>	
<span id="L4630" class="ln">  4630</span>	&#34;Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn&#39;t you come to Sunday-school?&#34;
<span id="L4631" class="ln">  4631</span>	
<span id="L4632" class="ln">  4632</span>	&#34;I did come--didn&#39;t you see me?&#34;
<span id="L4633" class="ln">  4633</span>	
<span id="L4634" class="ln">  4634</span>	&#34;Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?&#34;
<span id="L4635" class="ln">  4635</span>	
<span id="L4636" class="ln">  4636</span>	&#34;I was in Miss Peters&#39; class, where I always go. I saw YOU.&#34;
<span id="L4637" class="ln">  4637</span>	
<span id="L4638" class="ln">  4638</span>	&#34;Did you? Why, it&#39;s funny I didn&#39;t see you. I wanted to tell you about
<span id="L4639" class="ln">  4639</span>	the picnic.&#34;
<span id="L4640" class="ln">  4640</span>	
<span id="L4641" class="ln">  4641</span>	&#34;Oh, that&#39;s jolly. Who&#39;s going to give it?&#34;
<span id="L4642" class="ln">  4642</span>	
<span id="L4643" class="ln">  4643</span>	&#34;My ma&#39;s going to let me have one.&#34;
<span id="L4644" class="ln">  4644</span>	
<span id="L4645" class="ln">  4645</span>	&#34;Oh, goody; I hope she&#39;ll let ME come.&#34;
<span id="L4646" class="ln">  4646</span>	
<span id="L4647" class="ln">  4647</span>	&#34;Well, she will. The picnic&#39;s for me. She&#39;ll let anybody come that I
<span id="L4648" class="ln">  4648</span>	want, and I want you.&#34;
<span id="L4649" class="ln">  4649</span>	
<span id="L4650" class="ln">  4650</span>	&#34;That&#39;s ever so nice. When is it going to be?&#34;
<span id="L4651" class="ln">  4651</span>	
<span id="L4652" class="ln">  4652</span>	&#34;By and by. Maybe about vacation.&#34;
<span id="L4653" class="ln">  4653</span>	
<span id="L4654" class="ln">  4654</span>	&#34;Oh, won&#39;t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?&#34;
<span id="L4655" class="ln">  4655</span>	
<span id="L4656" class="ln">  4656</span>	&#34;Yes, every one that&#39;s friends to me--or wants to be&#34;; and she glanced
<span id="L4657" class="ln">  4657</span>	ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence
<span id="L4658" class="ln">  4658</span>	about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the
<span id="L4659" class="ln">  4659</span>	great sycamore tree &#34;all to flinders&#34; while he was &#34;standing within
<span id="L4660" class="ln">  4660</span>	three feet of it.&#34;
<span id="L4661" class="ln">  4661</span>	
<span id="L4662" class="ln">  4662</span>	&#34;Oh, may I come?&#34; said Grace Miller.
<span id="L4663" class="ln">  4663</span>	
<span id="L4664" class="ln">  4664</span>	&#34;Yes.&#34;
<span id="L4665" class="ln">  4665</span>	
<span id="L4666" class="ln">  4666</span>	&#34;And me?&#34; said Sally Rogers.
<span id="L4667" class="ln">  4667</span>	
<span id="L4668" class="ln">  4668</span>	&#34;Yes.&#34;
<span id="L4669" class="ln">  4669</span>	
<span id="L4670" class="ln">  4670</span>	&#34;And me, too?&#34; said Susy Harper. &#34;And Joe?&#34;
<span id="L4671" class="ln">  4671</span>	
<span id="L4672" class="ln">  4672</span>	&#34;Yes.&#34;
<span id="L4673" class="ln">  4673</span>	
<span id="L4674" class="ln">  4674</span>	And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
<span id="L4675" class="ln">  4675</span>	for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still
<span id="L4676" class="ln">  4676</span>	talking, and took Amy with him. Becky&#39;s lips trembled and the tears
<span id="L4677" class="ln">  4677</span>	came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
<span id="L4678" class="ln">  4678</span>	chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of
<span id="L4679" class="ln">  4679</span>	everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
<span id="L4680" class="ln">  4680</span>	had what her sex call &#34;a good cry.&#34; Then she sat moody, with wounded
<span id="L4681" class="ln">  4681</span>	pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast
<span id="L4682" class="ln">  4682</span>	in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
<span id="L4683" class="ln">  4683</span>	SHE&#39;D do.
<span id="L4684" class="ln">  4684</span>	
<span id="L4685" class="ln">  4685</span>	At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
<span id="L4686" class="ln">  4686</span>	self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
<span id="L4687" class="ln">  4687</span>	her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden
<span id="L4688" class="ln">  4688</span>	falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
<span id="L4689" class="ln">  4689</span>	the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so
<span id="L4690" class="ln">  4690</span>	absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
<span id="L4691" class="ln">  4691</span>	that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
<span id="L4692" class="ln">  4692</span>	Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom&#39;s veins. He began to hate himself for
<span id="L4693" class="ln">  4693</span>	throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He
<span id="L4694" class="ln">  4694</span>	called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He
<span id="L4695" class="ln">  4695</span>	wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
<span id="L4696" class="ln">  4696</span>	for her heart was singing, but Tom&#39;s tongue had lost its function. He
<span id="L4697" class="ln">  4697</span>	did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he
<span id="L4698" class="ln">  4698</span>	could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as
<span id="L4699" class="ln">  4699</span>	otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and
<span id="L4700" class="ln">  4700</span>	again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could
<span id="L4701" class="ln">  4701</span>	not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that
<span id="L4702" class="ln">  4702</span>	Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
<span id="L4703" class="ln">  4703</span>	living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her
<span id="L4704" class="ln">  4704</span>	fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.
<span id="L4705" class="ln">  4705</span>	
<span id="L4706" class="ln">  4706</span>	Amy&#39;s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to
<span id="L4707" class="ln">  4707</span>	attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in
<span id="L4708" class="ln">  4708</span>	vain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, &#34;Oh, hang her, ain&#39;t I ever
<span id="L4709" class="ln">  4709</span>	going to get rid of her?&#34; At last he must be attending to those
<span id="L4710" class="ln">  4710</span>	things--and she said artlessly that she would be &#34;around&#34; when school
<span id="L4711" class="ln">  4711</span>	let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.
<span id="L4712" class="ln">  4712</span>	
<span id="L4713" class="ln">  4713</span>	&#34;Any other boy!&#34; Tom thought, grating his teeth. &#34;Any boy in the whole
<span id="L4714" class="ln">  4714</span>	town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
<span id="L4715" class="ln">  4715</span>	aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw
<span id="L4716" class="ln">  4716</span>	this town, mister, and I&#39;ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch
<span id="L4717" class="ln">  4717</span>	you out! I&#39;ll just take and--&#34;
<span id="L4718" class="ln">  4718</span>	
<span id="L4719" class="ln">  4719</span>	And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy
<span id="L4720" class="ln">  4720</span>	--pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. &#34;Oh, you do, do you? You
<span id="L4721" class="ln">  4721</span>	holler &#39;nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!&#34; And so the
<span id="L4722" class="ln">  4722</span>	imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.
<span id="L4723" class="ln">  4723</span>	
<span id="L4724" class="ln">  4724</span>	Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of
<span id="L4725" class="ln">  4725</span>	Amy&#39;s grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the
<span id="L4726" class="ln">  4726</span>	other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but
<span id="L4727" class="ln">  4727</span>	as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph
<span id="L4728" class="ln">  4728</span>	began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness
<span id="L4729" class="ln">  4729</span>	followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her
<span id="L4730" class="ln">  4730</span>	ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she
<span id="L4731" class="ln">  4731</span>	grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn&#39;t carried it so far. When
<span id="L4732" class="ln">  4732</span>	poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept
<span id="L4733" class="ln">  4733</span>	exclaiming: &#34;Oh, here&#39;s a jolly one! look at this!&#34; she lost patience
<span id="L4734" class="ln">  4734</span>	at last, and said, &#34;Oh, don&#39;t bother me! I don&#39;t care for them!&#34; and
<span id="L4735" class="ln">  4735</span>	burst into tears, and got up and walked away.
<span id="L4736" class="ln">  4736</span>	
<span id="L4737" class="ln">  4737</span>	Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
<span id="L4738" class="ln">  4738</span>	said:
<span id="L4739" class="ln">  4739</span>	
<span id="L4740" class="ln">  4740</span>	&#34;Go away and leave me alone, can&#39;t you! I hate you!&#34;
<span id="L4741" class="ln">  4741</span>	
<span id="L4742" class="ln">  4742</span>	So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said
<span id="L4743" class="ln">  4743</span>	she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,
<span id="L4744" class="ln">  4744</span>	crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was
<span id="L4745" class="ln">  4745</span>	humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl
<span id="L4746" class="ln">  4746</span>	had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.
<span id="L4747" class="ln">  4747</span>	He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.
<span id="L4748" class="ln">  4748</span>	He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
<span id="L4749" class="ln">  4749</span>	risk to himself. Tom&#39;s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his
<span id="L4750" class="ln">  4750</span>	opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
<span id="L4751" class="ln">  4751</span>	poured ink upon the page.
<span id="L4752" class="ln">  4752</span>	
<span id="L4753" class="ln">  4753</span>	Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,
<span id="L4754" class="ln">  4754</span>	and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,
<span id="L4755" class="ln">  4755</span>	intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their
<span id="L4756" class="ln">  4756</span>	troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she
<span id="L4757" class="ln">  4757</span>	had changed her mind. The thought of Tom&#39;s treatment of her when she
<span id="L4758" class="ln">  4758</span>	was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with
<span id="L4759" class="ln">  4759</span>	shame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged
<span id="L4760" class="ln">  4760</span>	spelling-book&#39;s account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.
<span id="L4761" class="ln">  4761</span>	
<span id="L4762" class="ln">  4762</span>	
<span id="L4763" class="ln">  4763</span>	
<span id="L4764" class="ln">  4764</span>	CHAPTER XIX
<span id="L4765" class="ln">  4765</span>	
<span id="L4766" class="ln">  4766</span>	TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt
<span id="L4767" class="ln">  4767</span>	said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an
<span id="L4768" class="ln">  4768</span>	unpromising market:
<span id="L4769" class="ln">  4769</span>	
<span id="L4770" class="ln">  4770</span>	&#34;Tom, I&#39;ve a notion to skin you alive!&#34;
<span id="L4771" class="ln">  4771</span>	
<span id="L4772" class="ln">  4772</span>	&#34;Auntie, what have I done?&#34;
<span id="L4773" class="ln">  4773</span>	
<span id="L4774" class="ln">  4774</span>	&#34;Well, you&#39;ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an
<span id="L4775" class="ln">  4775</span>	old softy, expecting I&#39;m going to make her believe all that rubbage
<span id="L4776" class="ln">  4776</span>	about that dream, when lo and behold you she&#39;d found out from Joe that
<span id="L4777" class="ln">  4777</span>	you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I
<span id="L4778" class="ln">  4778</span>	don&#39;t know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes
<span id="L4779" class="ln">  4779</span>	me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make
<span id="L4780" class="ln">  4780</span>	such a fool of myself and never say a word.&#34;
<span id="L4781" class="ln">  4781</span>	
<span id="L4782" class="ln">  4782</span>	This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had
<span id="L4783" class="ln">  4783</span>	seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked
<span id="L4784" class="ln">  4784</span>	mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything
<span id="L4785" class="ln">  4785</span>	to say for a moment. Then he said:
<span id="L4786" class="ln">  4786</span>	
<span id="L4787" class="ln">  4787</span>	&#34;Auntie, I wish I hadn&#39;t done it--but I didn&#39;t think.&#34;
<span id="L4788" class="ln">  4788</span>	
<span id="L4789" class="ln">  4789</span>	&#34;Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own
<span id="L4790" class="ln">  4790</span>	selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from
<span id="L4791" class="ln">  4791</span>	Jackson&#39;s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could
<span id="L4792" class="ln">  4792</span>	think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn&#39;t ever think
<span id="L4793" class="ln">  4793</span>	to pity us and save us from sorrow.&#34;
<span id="L4794" class="ln">  4794</span>	
<span id="L4795" class="ln">  4795</span>	&#34;Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn&#39;t mean to be mean. I
<span id="L4796" class="ln">  4796</span>	didn&#39;t, honest. And besides, I didn&#39;t come over here to laugh at you
<span id="L4797" class="ln">  4797</span>	that night.&#34;
<span id="L4798" class="ln">  4798</span>	
<span id="L4799" class="ln">  4799</span>	&#34;What did you come for, then?&#34;
<span id="L4800" class="ln">  4800</span>	
<span id="L4801" class="ln">  4801</span>	&#34;It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn&#39;t got
<span id="L4802" class="ln">  4802</span>	drownded.&#34;
<span id="L4803" class="ln">  4803</span>	
<span id="L4804" class="ln">  4804</span>	&#34;Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
<span id="L4805" class="ln">  4805</span>	believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never
<span id="L4806" class="ln">  4806</span>	did--and I know it, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L4807" class="ln">  4807</span>	
<span id="L4808" class="ln">  4808</span>	&#34;Indeed and &#39;deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L4809" class="ln">  4809</span>	
<span id="L4810" class="ln">  4810</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom, don&#39;t lie--don&#39;t do it. It only makes things a hundred times
<span id="L4811" class="ln">  4811</span>	worse.&#34;
<span id="L4812" class="ln">  4812</span>	
<span id="L4813" class="ln">  4813</span>	&#34;It ain&#39;t a lie, auntie; it&#39;s the truth. I wanted to keep you from
<span id="L4814" class="ln">  4814</span>	grieving--that was all that made me come.&#34;
<span id="L4815" class="ln">  4815</span>	
<span id="L4816" class="ln">  4816</span>	&#34;I&#39;d give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power
<span id="L4817" class="ln">  4817</span>	of sins, Tom. I&#39;d &#39;most be glad you&#39;d run off and acted so bad. But it
<span id="L4818" class="ln">  4818</span>	ain&#39;t reasonable; because, why didn&#39;t you tell me, child?&#34;
<span id="L4819" class="ln">  4819</span>	
<span id="L4820" class="ln">  4820</span>	&#34;Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got
<span id="L4821" class="ln">  4821</span>	all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I
<span id="L4822" class="ln">  4822</span>	couldn&#39;t somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my
<span id="L4823" class="ln">  4823</span>	pocket and kept mum.&#34;
<span id="L4824" class="ln">  4824</span>	
<span id="L4825" class="ln">  4825</span>	&#34;What bark?&#34;
<span id="L4826" class="ln">  4826</span>	
<span id="L4827" class="ln">  4827</span>	&#34;The bark I had wrote on to tell you we&#39;d gone pirating. I wish, now,
<span id="L4828" class="ln">  4828</span>	you&#39;d waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.&#34;
<span id="L4829" class="ln">  4829</span>	
<span id="L4830" class="ln">  4830</span>	The hard lines in his aunt&#39;s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness
<span id="L4831" class="ln">  4831</span>	dawned in her eyes.
<span id="L4832" class="ln">  4832</span>	
<span id="L4833" class="ln">  4833</span>	&#34;DID you kiss me, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L4834" class="ln">  4834</span>	
<span id="L4835" class="ln">  4835</span>	&#34;Why, yes, I did.&#34;
<span id="L4836" class="ln">  4836</span>	
<span id="L4837" class="ln">  4837</span>	&#34;Are you sure you did, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L4838" class="ln">  4838</span>	
<span id="L4839" class="ln">  4839</span>	&#34;Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.&#34;
<span id="L4840" class="ln">  4840</span>	
<span id="L4841" class="ln">  4841</span>	&#34;What did you kiss me for, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L4842" class="ln">  4842</span>	
<span id="L4843" class="ln">  4843</span>	&#34;Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.&#34;
<span id="L4844" class="ln">  4844</span>	
<span id="L4845" class="ln">  4845</span>	The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in
<span id="L4846" class="ln">  4846</span>	her voice when she said:
<span id="L4847" class="ln">  4847</span>	
<span id="L4848" class="ln">  4848</span>	&#34;Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don&#39;t
<span id="L4849" class="ln">  4849</span>	bother me any more.&#34;
<span id="L4850" class="ln">  4850</span>	
<span id="L4851" class="ln">  4851</span>	The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
<span id="L4852" class="ln">  4852</span>	jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her
<span id="L4853" class="ln">  4853</span>	hand, and said to herself:
<span id="L4854" class="ln">  4854</span>	
<span id="L4855" class="ln">  4855</span>	&#34;No, I don&#39;t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he&#39;s lied about it--but it&#39;s a
<span id="L4856" class="ln">  4856</span>	blessed, blessed lie, there&#39;s such a comfort come from it. I hope the
<span id="L4857" class="ln">  4857</span>	Lord--I KNOW the Lord will forgive him, because it was such
<span id="L4858" class="ln">  4858</span>	goodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don&#39;t want to find out it&#39;s a
<span id="L4859" class="ln">  4859</span>	lie. I won&#39;t look.&#34;
<span id="L4860" class="ln">  4860</span>	
<span id="L4861" class="ln">  4861</span>	She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put
<span id="L4862" class="ln">  4862</span>	out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once
<span id="L4863" class="ln">  4863</span>	more she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the
<span id="L4864" class="ln">  4864</span>	thought: &#34;It&#39;s a good lie--it&#39;s a good lie--I won&#39;t let it grieve me.&#34;
<span id="L4865" class="ln">  4865</span>	So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom&#39;s
<span id="L4866" class="ln">  4866</span>	piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: &#34;I could forgive the
<span id="L4867" class="ln">  4867</span>	boy, now, if he&#39;d committed a million sins!&#34;
<span id="L4868" class="ln">  4868</span>	
<span id="L4869" class="ln">  4869</span>	
<span id="L4870" class="ln">  4870</span>	
<span id="L4871" class="ln">  4871</span>	CHAPTER XX
<span id="L4872" class="ln">  4872</span>	
<span id="L4873" class="ln">  4873</span>	THERE was something about Aunt Polly&#39;s manner, when she kissed Tom,
<span id="L4874" class="ln">  4874</span>	that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy
<span id="L4875" class="ln">  4875</span>	again. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky
<span id="L4876" class="ln">  4876</span>	Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his
<span id="L4877" class="ln">  4877</span>	manner. Without a moment&#39;s hesitation he ran to her and said:
<span id="L4878" class="ln">  4878</span>	
<span id="L4879" class="ln">  4879</span>	&#34;I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I&#39;m so sorry. I won&#39;t ever,
<span id="L4880" class="ln">  4880</span>	ever do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won&#39;t
<span id="L4881" class="ln">  4881</span>	you?&#34;
<span id="L4882" class="ln">  4882</span>	
<span id="L4883" class="ln">  4883</span>	The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:
<span id="L4884" class="ln">  4884</span>	
<span id="L4885" class="ln">  4885</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I&#39;ll
<span id="L4886" class="ln">  4886</span>	never speak to you again.&#34;
<span id="L4887" class="ln">  4887</span>	
<span id="L4888" class="ln">  4888</span>	She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not
<span id="L4889" class="ln">  4889</span>	even presence of mind enough to say &#34;Who cares, Miss Smarty?&#34; until the
<span id="L4890" class="ln">  4890</span>	right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a
<span id="L4891" class="ln">  4891</span>	fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
<span id="L4892" class="ln">  4892</span>	a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently
<span id="L4893" class="ln">  4893</span>	encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She
<span id="L4894" class="ln">  4894</span>	hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to
<span id="L4895" class="ln">  4895</span>	Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to
<span id="L4896" class="ln">  4896</span>	&#34;take in,&#34; she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured
<span id="L4897" class="ln">  4897</span>	spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred
<span id="L4898" class="ln">  4898</span>	Temple, Tom&#39;s offensive fling had driven it entirely away.
<span id="L4899" class="ln">  4899</span>	
<span id="L4900" class="ln">  4900</span>	Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.
<span id="L4901" class="ln">  4901</span>	The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
<span id="L4902" class="ln">  4902</span>	ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty
<span id="L4903" class="ln">  4903</span>	had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
<span id="L4904" class="ln">  4904</span>	schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
<span id="L4905" class="ln">  4905</span>	absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept
<span id="L4906" class="ln">  4906</span>	that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was
<span id="L4907" class="ln">  4907</span>	perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy
<span id="L4908" class="ln">  4908</span>	and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two
<span id="L4909" class="ln">  4909</span>	theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in
<span id="L4910" class="ln">  4910</span>	the case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the
<span id="L4911" class="ln">  4911</span>	door, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious
<span id="L4912" class="ln">  4912</span>	moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant
<span id="L4913" class="ln">  4913</span>	she had the book in her hands. The title-page--Professor Somebody&#39;s
<span id="L4914" class="ln">  4914</span>	ANATOMY--carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the
<span id="L4915" class="ln">  4915</span>	leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored
<span id="L4916" class="ln">  4916</span>	frontispiece--a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell
<span id="L4917" class="ln">  4917</span>	on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse
<span id="L4918" class="ln">  4918</span>	of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the
<span id="L4919" class="ln">  4919</span>	hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust
<span id="L4920" class="ln">  4920</span>	the volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with
<span id="L4921" class="ln">  4921</span>	shame and vexation.
<span id="L4922" class="ln">  4922</span>	
<span id="L4923" class="ln">  4923</span>	&#34;Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a
<span id="L4924" class="ln">  4924</span>	person and look at what they&#39;re looking at.&#34;
<span id="L4925" class="ln">  4925</span>	
<span id="L4926" class="ln">  4926</span>	&#34;How could I know you was looking at anything?&#34;
<span id="L4927" class="ln">  4927</span>	
<span id="L4928" class="ln">  4928</span>	&#34;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you&#39;re
<span id="L4929" class="ln">  4929</span>	going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I&#39;ll be
<span id="L4930" class="ln">  4930</span>	whipped, and I never was whipped in school.&#34;
<span id="L4931" class="ln">  4931</span>	
<span id="L4932" class="ln">  4932</span>	Then she stamped her little foot and said:
<span id="L4933" class="ln">  4933</span>	
<span id="L4934" class="ln">  4934</span>	&#34;BE so mean if you want to! I know something that&#39;s going to happen.
<span id="L4935" class="ln">  4935</span>	You just wait and you&#39;ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!&#34;--and she
<span id="L4936" class="ln">  4936</span>	flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.
<span id="L4937" class="ln">  4937</span>	
<span id="L4938" class="ln">  4938</span>	Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said
<span id="L4939" class="ln">  4939</span>	to himself:
<span id="L4940" class="ln">  4940</span>	
<span id="L4941" class="ln">  4941</span>	&#34;What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school!
<span id="L4942" class="ln">  4942</span>	Shucks! What&#39;s a licking! That&#39;s just like a girl--they&#39;re so
<span id="L4943" class="ln">  4943</span>	thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain&#39;t going to tell
<span id="L4944" class="ln">  4944</span>	old Dobbins on this little fool, because there&#39;s other ways of getting
<span id="L4945" class="ln">  4945</span>	even on her, that ain&#39;t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask
<span id="L4946" class="ln">  4946</span>	who it was tore his book. Nobody&#39;ll answer. Then he&#39;ll do just the way
<span id="L4947" class="ln">  4947</span>	he always does--ask first one and then t&#39;other, and when he comes to the
<span id="L4948" class="ln">  4948</span>	right girl he&#39;ll know it, without any telling. Girls&#39; faces always tell
<span id="L4949" class="ln">  4949</span>	on them. They ain&#39;t got any backbone. She&#39;ll get licked. Well, it&#39;s a
<span id="L4950" class="ln">  4950</span>	kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain&#39;t any way
<span id="L4951" class="ln">  4951</span>	out of it.&#34; Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: &#34;All
<span id="L4952" class="ln">  4952</span>	right, though; she&#39;d like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it
<span id="L4953" class="ln">  4953</span>	out!&#34;
<span id="L4954" class="ln">  4954</span>	
<span id="L4955" class="ln">  4955</span>	Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments
<span id="L4956" class="ln">  4956</span>	the master arrived and school &#34;took in.&#34; Tom did not feel a strong
<span id="L4957" class="ln">  4957</span>	interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls&#39;
<span id="L4958" class="ln">  4958</span>	side of the room Becky&#39;s face troubled him. Considering all things, he
<span id="L4959" class="ln">  4959</span>	did not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He
<span id="L4960" class="ln">  4960</span>	could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently
<span id="L4961" class="ln">  4961</span>	the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom&#39;s mind was entirely full
<span id="L4962" class="ln">  4962</span>	of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her
<span id="L4963" class="ln">  4963</span>	lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She
<span id="L4964" class="ln">  4964</span>	did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
<span id="L4965" class="ln">  4965</span>	spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only
<span id="L4966" class="ln">  4966</span>	seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be
<span id="L4967" class="ln">  4967</span>	glad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she
<span id="L4968" class="ln">  4968</span>	found she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an
<span id="L4969" class="ln">  4969</span>	impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and
<span id="L4970" class="ln">  4970</span>	forced herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, &#34;he&#39;ll tell
<span id="L4971" class="ln">  4971</span>	about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn&#39;t say a word, not to save
<span id="L4972" class="ln">  4972</span>	his life!&#34;
<span id="L4973" class="ln">  4973</span>	
<span id="L4974" class="ln">  4974</span>	Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
<span id="L4975" class="ln">  4975</span>	broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
<span id="L4976" class="ln">  4976</span>	upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he
<span id="L4977" class="ln">  4977</span>	had denied it for form&#39;s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck
<span id="L4978" class="ln">  4978</span>	to the denial from principle.
<span id="L4979" class="ln">  4979</span>	
<span id="L4980" class="ln">  4980</span>	A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air
<span id="L4981" class="ln">  4981</span>	was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened
<span id="L4982" class="ln">  4982</span>	himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,
<span id="L4983" class="ln">  4983</span>	but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the
<span id="L4984" class="ln">  4984</span>	pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched
<span id="L4985" class="ln">  4985</span>	his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently
<span id="L4986" class="ln">  4986</span>	for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!
<span id="L4987" class="ln">  4987</span>	Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
<span id="L4988" class="ln">  4988</span>	look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot
<span id="L4989" class="ln">  4989</span>	his quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,
<span id="L4990" class="ln">  4990</span>	too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
<span id="L4991" class="ln">  4991</span>	Good!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring
<span id="L4992" class="ln">  4992</span>	through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little
<span id="L4993" class="ln">  4993</span>	instant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom
<span id="L4994" class="ln">  4994</span>	only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help
<span id="L4995" class="ln">  4995</span>	for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.
<span id="L4996" class="ln">  4996</span>	Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even
<span id="L4997" class="ln">  4997</span>	the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten
<span id="L4998" class="ln">  4998</span>	--the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: &#34;Who tore this book?&#34;
<span id="L4999" class="ln">  4999</span>	
<span id="L5000" class="ln">  5000</span>	There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
<span id="L5001" class="ln">  5001</span>	continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.
<span id="L5002" class="ln">  5002</span>	
<span id="L5003" class="ln">  5003</span>	&#34;Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?&#34;
<span id="L5004" class="ln">  5004</span>	
<span id="L5005" class="ln">  5005</span>	A denial. Another pause.
<span id="L5006" class="ln">  5006</span>	
<span id="L5007" class="ln">  5007</span>	&#34;Joseph Harper, did you?&#34;
<span id="L5008" class="ln">  5008</span>	
<span id="L5009" class="ln">  5009</span>	Another denial. Tom&#39;s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
<span id="L5010" class="ln">  5010</span>	slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of
<span id="L5011" class="ln">  5011</span>	boys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:
<span id="L5012" class="ln">  5012</span>	
<span id="L5013" class="ln">  5013</span>	&#34;Amy Lawrence?&#34;
<span id="L5014" class="ln">  5014</span>	
<span id="L5015" class="ln">  5015</span>	A shake of the head.
<span id="L5016" class="ln">  5016</span>	
<span id="L5017" class="ln">  5017</span>	&#34;Gracie Miller?&#34;
<span id="L5018" class="ln">  5018</span>	
<span id="L5019" class="ln">  5019</span>	The same sign.
<span id="L5020" class="ln">  5020</span>	
<span id="L5021" class="ln">  5021</span>	&#34;Susan Harper, did you do this?&#34;
<span id="L5022" class="ln">  5022</span>	
<span id="L5023" class="ln">  5023</span>	Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling
<span id="L5024" class="ln">  5024</span>	from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of
<span id="L5025" class="ln">  5025</span>	the situation.
<span id="L5026" class="ln">  5026</span>	
<span id="L5027" class="ln">  5027</span>	&#34;Rebecca Thatcher&#34; [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with terror]
<span id="L5028" class="ln">  5028</span>	--&#34;did you tear--no, look me in the face&#34; [her hands rose in appeal]
<span id="L5029" class="ln">  5029</span>	--&#34;did you tear this book?&#34;
<span id="L5030" class="ln">  5030</span>	
<span id="L5031" class="ln">  5031</span>	A thought shot like lightning through Tom&#39;s brain. He sprang to his
<span id="L5032" class="ln">  5032</span>	feet and shouted--&#34;I done it!&#34;
<span id="L5033" class="ln">  5033</span>	
<span id="L5034" class="ln">  5034</span>	The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a
<span id="L5035" class="ln">  5035</span>	moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped
<span id="L5036" class="ln">  5036</span>	forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the
<span id="L5037" class="ln">  5037</span>	adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky&#39;s eyes seemed pay
<span id="L5038" class="ln">  5038</span>	enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own
<span id="L5039" class="ln">  5039</span>	act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr.
<span id="L5040" class="ln">  5040</span>	Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the
<span id="L5041" class="ln">  5041</span>	added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be
<span id="L5042" class="ln">  5042</span>	dismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his
<span id="L5043" class="ln">  5043</span>	captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.
<span id="L5044" class="ln">  5044</span>	
<span id="L5045" class="ln">  5045</span>	Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple;
<span id="L5046" class="ln">  5046</span>	for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting
<span id="L5047" class="ln">  5047</span>	her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way,
<span id="L5048" class="ln">  5048</span>	soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky&#39;s
<span id="L5049" class="ln">  5049</span>	latest words lingering dreamily in his ear--
<span id="L5050" class="ln">  5050</span>	
<span id="L5051" class="ln">  5051</span>	&#34;Tom, how COULD you be so noble!&#34;
<span id="L5052" class="ln">  5052</span>	
<span id="L5053" class="ln">  5053</span>	
<span id="L5054" class="ln">  5054</span>	
<span id="L5055" class="ln">  5055</span>	CHAPTER XXI
<span id="L5056" class="ln">  5056</span>	
<span id="L5057" class="ln">  5057</span>	VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew
<span id="L5058" class="ln">  5058</span>	severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a
<span id="L5059" class="ln">  5059</span>	good showing on &#34;Examination&#34; day. His rod and his ferule were seldom
<span id="L5060" class="ln">  5060</span>	idle now--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and
<span id="L5061" class="ln">  5061</span>	young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins&#39;
<span id="L5062" class="ln">  5062</span>	lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under
<span id="L5063" class="ln">  5063</span>	his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle
<span id="L5064" class="ln">  5064</span>	age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great
<span id="L5065" class="ln">  5065</span>	day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he
<span id="L5066" class="ln">  5066</span>	seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least
<span id="L5067" class="ln">  5067</span>	shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their
<span id="L5068" class="ln">  5068</span>	days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They
<span id="L5069" class="ln">  5069</span>	threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept
<span id="L5070" class="ln">  5070</span>	ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful
<span id="L5071" class="ln">  5071</span>	success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from
<span id="L5072" class="ln">  5072</span>	the field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a
<span id="L5073" class="ln">  5073</span>	plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the sign-painter&#39;s
<span id="L5074" class="ln">  5074</span>	boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons
<span id="L5075" class="ln">  5075</span>	for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father&#39;s family and
<span id="L5076" class="ln">  5076</span>	had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master&#39;s wife would go
<span id="L5077" class="ln">  5077</span>	on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to
<span id="L5078" class="ln">  5078</span>	interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great
<span id="L5079" class="ln">  5079</span>	occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter&#39;s boy
<span id="L5080" class="ln">  5080</span>	said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on
<span id="L5081" class="ln">  5081</span>	Examination Evening he would &#34;manage the thing&#34; while he napped in his
<span id="L5082" class="ln">  5082</span>	chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried
<span id="L5083" class="ln">  5083</span>	away to school.
<span id="L5084" class="ln">  5084</span>	
<span id="L5085" class="ln">  5085</span>	In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in
<span id="L5086" class="ln">  5086</span>	the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with
<span id="L5087" class="ln">  5087</span>	wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in
<span id="L5088" class="ln">  5088</span>	his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.
<span id="L5089" class="ln">  5089</span>	He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and
<span id="L5090" class="ln">  5090</span>	six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
<span id="L5091" class="ln">  5091</span>	and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of
<span id="L5092" class="ln">  5092</span>	citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
<span id="L5093" class="ln">  5093</span>	scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
<span id="L5094" class="ln">  5094</span>	small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
<span id="L5095" class="ln">  5095</span>	rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
<span id="L5096" class="ln">  5096</span>	lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their
<span id="L5097" class="ln">  5097</span>	grandmothers&#39; ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
<span id="L5098" class="ln">  5098</span>	the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with
<span id="L5099" class="ln">  5099</span>	non-participating scholars.
<span id="L5100" class="ln">  5100</span>	
<span id="L5101" class="ln">  5101</span>	The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly
<span id="L5102" class="ln">  5102</span>	recited, &#34;You&#39;d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the
<span id="L5103" class="ln">  5103</span>	stage,&#34; etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and
<span id="L5104" class="ln">  5104</span>	spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the
<span id="L5105" class="ln">  5105</span>	machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though
<span id="L5106" class="ln">  5106</span>	cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his
<span id="L5107" class="ln">  5107</span>	manufactured bow and retired.
<span id="L5108" class="ln">  5108</span>	
<span id="L5109" class="ln">  5109</span>	A little shamefaced girl lisped, &#34;Mary had a little lamb,&#34; etc.,
<span id="L5110" class="ln">  5110</span>	performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and
<span id="L5111" class="ln">  5111</span>	sat down flushed and happy.
<span id="L5112" class="ln">  5112</span>	
<span id="L5113" class="ln">  5113</span>	Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
<span id="L5114" class="ln">  5114</span>	the unquenchable and indestructible &#34;Give me liberty or give me death&#34;
<span id="L5115" class="ln">  5115</span>	speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the
<span id="L5116" class="ln">  5116</span>	middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under
<span id="L5117" class="ln">  5117</span>	him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the
<span id="L5118" class="ln">  5118</span>	house but he had the house&#39;s silence, too, which was even worse than
<span id="L5119" class="ln">  5119</span>	its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom
<span id="L5120" class="ln">  5120</span>	struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak
<span id="L5121" class="ln">  5121</span>	attempt at applause, but it died early.
<span id="L5122" class="ln">  5122</span>	
<span id="L5123" class="ln">  5123</span>	&#34;The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck&#34; followed; also &#34;The Assyrian Came
<span id="L5124" class="ln">  5124</span>	Down,&#34; and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,
<span id="L5125" class="ln">  5125</span>	and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The
<span id="L5126" class="ln">  5126</span>	prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original &#34;compositions&#34;
<span id="L5127" class="ln">  5127</span>	by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of
<span id="L5128" class="ln">  5128</span>	the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with
<span id="L5129" class="ln">  5129</span>	dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to
<span id="L5130" class="ln">  5130</span>	&#34;expression&#34; and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been
<span id="L5131" class="ln">  5131</span>	illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their
<span id="L5132" class="ln">  5132</span>	grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line
<span id="L5133" class="ln">  5133</span>	clear back to the Crusades. &#34;Friendship&#34; was one; &#34;Memories of Other
<span id="L5134" class="ln">  5134</span>	Days&#34;; &#34;Religion in History&#34;; &#34;Dream Land&#34;; &#34;The Advantages of
<span id="L5135" class="ln">  5135</span>	Culture&#34;; &#34;Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted&#34;;
<span id="L5136" class="ln">  5136</span>	&#34;Melancholy&#34;; &#34;Filial Love&#34;; &#34;Heart Longings,&#34; etc., etc.
<span id="L5137" class="ln">  5137</span>	
<span id="L5138" class="ln">  5138</span>	A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
<span id="L5139" class="ln">  5139</span>	melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of &#34;fine language&#34;;
<span id="L5140" class="ln">  5140</span>	another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words
<span id="L5141" class="ln">  5141</span>	and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that
<span id="L5142" class="ln">  5142</span>	conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable
<span id="L5143" class="ln">  5143</span>	sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one
<span id="L5144" class="ln">  5144</span>	of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort
<span id="L5145" class="ln">  5145</span>	was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and
<span id="L5146" class="ln">  5146</span>	religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring
<span id="L5147" class="ln">  5147</span>	insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the
<span id="L5148" class="ln">  5148</span>	banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient
<span id="L5149" class="ln">  5149</span>	to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps.
<span id="L5150" class="ln">  5150</span>	There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel
<span id="L5151" class="ln">  5151</span>	obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find
<span id="L5152" class="ln">  5152</span>	that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in
<span id="L5153" class="ln">  5153</span>	the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But
<span id="L5154" class="ln">  5154</span>	enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.
<span id="L5155" class="ln">  5155</span>	
<span id="L5156" class="ln">  5156</span>	Let us return to the &#34;Examination.&#34; The first composition that was
<span id="L5157" class="ln">  5157</span>	read was one entitled &#34;Is this, then, Life?&#34; Perhaps the reader can
<span id="L5158" class="ln">  5158</span>	endure an extract from it:
<span id="L5159" class="ln">  5159</span>	
<span id="L5160" class="ln">  5160</span>	  &#34;In the common walks of life, with what delightful
<span id="L5161" class="ln">  5161</span>	   emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some
<span id="L5162" class="ln">  5162</span>	   anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy
<span id="L5163" class="ln">  5163</span>	   sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the
<span id="L5164" class="ln">  5164</span>	   voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the
<span id="L5165" class="ln">  5165</span>	   festive throng, &#39;the observed of all observers.&#39; Her
<span id="L5166" class="ln">  5166</span>	   graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling
<span id="L5167" class="ln">  5167</span>	   through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is
<span id="L5168" class="ln">  5168</span>	   brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.
<span id="L5169" class="ln">  5169</span>	
<span id="L5170" class="ln">  5170</span>	  &#34;In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by,
<span id="L5171" class="ln">  5171</span>	   and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into
<span id="L5172" class="ln">  5172</span>	   the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright
<span id="L5173" class="ln">  5173</span>	   dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to
<span id="L5174" class="ln">  5174</span>	   her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming
<span id="L5175" class="ln">  5175</span>	   than the last. But after a while she finds that
<span id="L5176" class="ln">  5176</span>	   beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the
<span id="L5177" class="ln">  5177</span>	   flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates
<span id="L5178" class="ln">  5178</span>	   harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its
<span id="L5179" class="ln">  5179</span>	   charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,
<span id="L5180" class="ln">  5180</span>	   she turns away with the conviction that earthly
<span id="L5181" class="ln">  5181</span>	   pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!&#34;
<span id="L5182" class="ln">  5182</span>	
<span id="L5183" class="ln">  5183</span>	And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to
<span id="L5184" class="ln">  5184</span>	time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of &#34;How
<span id="L5185" class="ln">  5185</span>	sweet!&#34; &#34;How eloquent!&#34; &#34;So true!&#34; etc., and after the thing had closed
<span id="L5186" class="ln">  5186</span>	with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.
<span id="L5187" class="ln">  5187</span>	
<span id="L5188" class="ln">  5188</span>	Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the &#34;interesting&#34;
<span id="L5189" class="ln">  5189</span>	paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a &#34;poem.&#34; Two
<span id="L5190" class="ln">  5190</span>	stanzas of it will do:
<span id="L5191" class="ln">  5191</span>	
<span id="L5192" class="ln">  5192</span>	   &#34;A MISSOURI MAIDEN&#39;S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA
<span id="L5193" class="ln">  5193</span>	
<span id="L5194" class="ln">  5194</span>	   &#34;Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well!
<span id="L5195" class="ln">  5195</span>	      But yet for a while do I leave thee now!
<span id="L5196" class="ln">  5196</span>	    Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,
<span id="L5197" class="ln">  5197</span>	      And burning recollections throng my brow!
<span id="L5198" class="ln">  5198</span>	    For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;
<span id="L5199" class="ln">  5199</span>	      Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa&#39;s stream;
<span id="L5200" class="ln">  5200</span>	    Have listened to Tallassee&#39;s warring floods,
<span id="L5201" class="ln">  5201</span>	      And wooed on Coosa&#39;s side Aurora&#39;s beam.
<span id="L5202" class="ln">  5202</span>	
<span id="L5203" class="ln">  5203</span>	   &#34;Yet shame I not to bear an o&#39;er-full heart,
<span id="L5204" class="ln">  5204</span>	      Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;
<span id="L5205" class="ln">  5205</span>	    &#39;Tis from no stranger land I now must part,
<span id="L5206" class="ln">  5206</span>	      &#39;Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.
<span id="L5207" class="ln">  5207</span>	    Welcome and home were mine within this State,
<span id="L5208" class="ln">  5208</span>	      Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me
<span id="L5209" class="ln">  5209</span>	    And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,
<span id="L5210" class="ln">  5210</span>	      When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!&#34;
<span id="L5211" class="ln">  5211</span>	
<span id="L5212" class="ln">  5212</span>	There were very few there who knew what &#34;tete&#34; meant, but the poem was
<span id="L5213" class="ln">  5213</span>	very satisfactory, nevertheless.
<span id="L5214" class="ln">  5214</span>	
<span id="L5215" class="ln">  5215</span>	Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young
<span id="L5216" class="ln">  5216</span>	lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and
<span id="L5217" class="ln">  5217</span>	began to read in a measured, solemn tone:
<span id="L5218" class="ln">  5218</span>	
<span id="L5219" class="ln">  5219</span>	  &#34;A VISION
<span id="L5220" class="ln">  5220</span>	
<span id="L5221" class="ln">  5221</span>	   &#34;Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the
<span id="L5222" class="ln">  5222</span>	   throne on high not a single star quivered; but
<span id="L5223" class="ln">  5223</span>	   the deep intonations of the heavy thunder
<span id="L5224" class="ln">  5224</span>	   constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the
<span id="L5225" class="ln">  5225</span>	   terrific lightning revelled in angry mood
<span id="L5226" class="ln">  5226</span>	   through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming
<span id="L5227" class="ln">  5227</span>	   to scorn the power exerted over its terror by
<span id="L5228" class="ln">  5228</span>	   the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous
<span id="L5229" class="ln">  5229</span>	   winds unanimously came forth from their mystic
<span id="L5230" class="ln">  5230</span>	   homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by
<span id="L5231" class="ln">  5231</span>	   their aid the wildness of the scene.
<span id="L5232" class="ln">  5232</span>	
<span id="L5233" class="ln">  5233</span>	   &#34;At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human
<span id="L5234" class="ln">  5234</span>	   sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,
<span id="L5235" class="ln">  5235</span>	
<span id="L5236" class="ln">  5236</span>	   &#34;&#39;My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter
<span id="L5237" class="ln">  5237</span>	   and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss
<span id="L5238" class="ln">  5238</span>	   in joy,&#39; came to my side. She moved like one of
<span id="L5239" class="ln">  5239</span>	   those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks
<span id="L5240" class="ln">  5240</span>	   of fancy&#39;s Eden by the romantic and young, a
<span id="L5241" class="ln">  5241</span>	   queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
<span id="L5242" class="ln">  5242</span>	   transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it
<span id="L5243" class="ln">  5243</span>	   failed to make even a sound, and but for the
<span id="L5244" class="ln">  5244</span>	   magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as
<span id="L5245" class="ln">  5245</span>	   other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided
<span id="L5246" class="ln">  5246</span>	   away un-perceived--unsought. A strange sadness
<span id="L5247" class="ln">  5247</span>	   rested upon her features, like icy tears upon
<span id="L5248" class="ln">  5248</span>	   the robe of December, as she pointed to the
<span id="L5249" class="ln">  5249</span>	   contending elements without, and bade me contemplate
<span id="L5250" class="ln">  5250</span>	   the two beings presented.&#34;
<span id="L5251" class="ln">  5251</span>	
<span id="L5252" class="ln">  5252</span>	This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with
<span id="L5253" class="ln">  5253</span>	a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took
<span id="L5254" class="ln">  5254</span>	the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest
<span id="L5255" class="ln">  5255</span>	effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the
<span id="L5256" class="ln">  5256</span>	prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it
<span id="L5257" class="ln">  5257</span>	was by far the most &#34;eloquent&#34; thing he had ever listened to, and that
<span id="L5258" class="ln">  5258</span>	Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.
<span id="L5259" class="ln">  5259</span>	
<span id="L5260" class="ln">  5260</span>	It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in
<span id="L5261" class="ln">  5261</span>	which the word &#34;beauteous&#34; was over-fondled, and human experience
<span id="L5262" class="ln">  5262</span>	referred to as &#34;life&#39;s page,&#34; was up to the usual average.
<span id="L5263" class="ln">  5263</span>	
<span id="L5264" class="ln">  5264</span>	Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair
<span id="L5265" class="ln">  5265</span>	aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of
<span id="L5266" class="ln">  5266</span>	America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he
<span id="L5267" class="ln">  5267</span>	made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered
<span id="L5268" class="ln">  5268</span>	titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set
<span id="L5269" class="ln">  5269</span>	himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only
<span id="L5270" class="ln">  5270</span>	distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced.
<span id="L5271" class="ln">  5271</span>	He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not
<span id="L5272" class="ln">  5272</span>	to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon
<span id="L5273" class="ln">  5273</span>	him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it
<span id="L5274" class="ln">  5274</span>	even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above,
<span id="L5275" class="ln">  5275</span>	pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle
<span id="L5276" class="ln">  5276</span>	came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag
<span id="L5277" class="ln">  5277</span>	tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly
<span id="L5278" class="ln">  5278</span>	descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung
<span id="L5279" class="ln">  5279</span>	downward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher
<span id="L5280" class="ln">  5280</span>	and higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher&#39;s
<span id="L5281" class="ln">  5281</span>	head--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her
<span id="L5282" class="ln">  5282</span>	desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an
<span id="L5283" class="ln">  5283</span>	instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did
<span id="L5284" class="ln">  5284</span>	blaze abroad from the master&#39;s bald pate--for the sign-painter&#39;s boy
<span id="L5285" class="ln">  5285</span>	had GILDED it!
<span id="L5286" class="ln">  5286</span>	
<span id="L5287" class="ln">  5287</span>	That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.
<span id="L5288" class="ln">  5288</span>

<span id="L5298" class="ln">  5298</span>	CHAPTER XXII
<span id="L5299" class="ln">  5299</span>	
<span id="L5300" class="ln">  5300</span>	TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by
<span id="L5301" class="ln">  5301</span>	the showy character of their &#34;regalia.&#34; He promised to abstain from
<span id="L5302" class="ln">  5302</span>	smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he
<span id="L5303" class="ln">  5303</span>	found out a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the
<span id="L5304" class="ln">  5304</span>	surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very
<span id="L5305" class="ln">  5305</span>	thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and
<span id="L5306" class="ln">  5306</span>	swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a
<span id="L5307" class="ln">  5307</span>	chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing
<span id="L5308" class="ln">  5308</span>	from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up
<span id="L5309" class="ln">  5309</span>	--gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and
<span id="L5310" class="ln">  5310</span>	fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was
<span id="L5311" class="ln">  5311</span>	apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since
<span id="L5312" class="ln">  5312</span>	he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned
<span id="L5313" class="ln">  5313</span>	about the Judge&#39;s condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his
<span id="L5314" class="ln">  5314</span>	hopes ran high--so high that he would venture to get out his regalia
<span id="L5315" class="ln">  5315</span>	and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most
<span id="L5316" class="ln">  5316</span>	discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the
<span id="L5317" class="ln">  5317</span>	mend--and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of
<span id="L5318" class="ln">  5318</span>	injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once--and that night the
<span id="L5319" class="ln">  5319</span>	Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never
<span id="L5320" class="ln">  5320</span>	trust a man like that again.
<span id="L5321" class="ln">  5321</span>	
<span id="L5322" class="ln">  5322</span>	The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated
<span id="L5323" class="ln">  5323</span>	to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however
<span id="L5324" class="ln">  5324</span>	--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but found
<span id="L5325" class="ln">  5325</span>	to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could,
<span id="L5326" class="ln">  5326</span>	took the desire away, and the charm of it.
<span id="L5327" class="ln">  5327</span>	
<span id="L5328" class="ln">  5328</span>	Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
<span id="L5329" class="ln">  5329</span>	to hang a little heavily on his hands.
<span id="L5330" class="ln">  5330</span>	
<span id="L5331" class="ln">  5331</span>	He attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so
<span id="L5332" class="ln">  5332</span>	he abandoned it.
<span id="L5333" class="ln">  5333</span>	
<span id="L5334" class="ln">  5334</span>	The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
<span id="L5335" class="ln">  5335</span>	sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were
<span id="L5336" class="ln">  5336</span>	happy for two days.
<span id="L5337" class="ln">  5337</span>	
<span id="L5338" class="ln">  5338</span>	Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
<span id="L5339" class="ln">  5339</span>	hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in
<span id="L5340" class="ln">  5340</span>	the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States
<span id="L5341" class="ln">  5341</span>	Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not
<span id="L5342" class="ln">  5342</span>	twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.
<span id="L5343" class="ln">  5343</span>	
<span id="L5344" class="ln">  5344</span>	A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in
<span id="L5345" class="ln">  5345</span>	tents made of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for
<span id="L5346" class="ln">  5346</span>	girls--and then circusing was abandoned.
<span id="L5347" class="ln">  5347</span>	
<span id="L5348" class="ln">  5348</span>	A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the
<span id="L5349" class="ln">  5349</span>	village duller and drearier than ever.
<span id="L5350" class="ln">  5350</span>	
<span id="L5351" class="ln">  5351</span>	There were some boys-and-girls&#39; parties, but they were so few and so
<span id="L5352" class="ln">  5352</span>	delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.
<span id="L5353" class="ln">  5353</span>	
<span id="L5354" class="ln">  5354</span>	Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
<span id="L5355" class="ln">  5355</span>	parents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.
<span id="L5356" class="ln">  5356</span>	
<span id="L5357" class="ln">  5357</span>	The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
<span id="L5358" class="ln">  5358</span>	cancer for permanency and pain.
<span id="L5359" class="ln">  5359</span>	
<span id="L5360" class="ln">  5360</span>	Then came the measles.
<span id="L5361" class="ln">  5361</span>	
<span id="L5362" class="ln">  5362</span>	During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
<span id="L5363" class="ln">  5363</span>	happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got
<span id="L5364" class="ln">  5364</span>	upon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a melancholy change
<span id="L5365" class="ln">  5365</span>	had come over everything and every creature. There had been a
<span id="L5366" class="ln">  5366</span>	&#34;revival,&#34; and everybody had &#34;got religion,&#34; not only the adults, but
<span id="L5367" class="ln">  5367</span>	even the boys and girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the
<span id="L5368" class="ln">  5368</span>	sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him
<span id="L5369" class="ln">  5369</span>	everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly
<span id="L5370" class="ln">  5370</span>	away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him
<span id="L5371" class="ln">  5371</span>	visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who
<span id="L5372" class="ln">  5372</span>	called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a
<span id="L5373" class="ln">  5373</span>	warning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression;
<span id="L5374" class="ln">  5374</span>	and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of
<span id="L5375" class="ln">  5375</span>	Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his
<span id="L5376" class="ln">  5376</span>	heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all
<span id="L5377" class="ln">  5377</span>	the town was lost, forever and forever.
<span id="L5378" class="ln">  5378</span>	
<span id="L5379" class="ln">  5379</span>	And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain,
<span id="L5380" class="ln">  5380</span>	awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his
<span id="L5381" class="ln">  5381</span>	head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his
<span id="L5382" class="ln">  5382</span>	doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was
<span id="L5383" class="ln">  5383</span>	about him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above
<span id="L5384" class="ln">  5384</span>	to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might
<span id="L5385" class="ln">  5385</span>	have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
<span id="L5386" class="ln">  5386</span>	battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
<span id="L5387" class="ln">  5387</span>	getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf
<span id="L5388" class="ln">  5388</span>	from under an insect like himself.
<span id="L5389" class="ln">  5389</span>	
<span id="L5390" class="ln">  5390</span>	By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
<span id="L5391" class="ln">  5391</span>	object. The boy&#39;s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His
<span id="L5392" class="ln">  5392</span>	second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.
<span id="L5393" class="ln">  5393</span>	
<span id="L5394" class="ln">  5394</span>	The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks
<span id="L5395" class="ln">  5395</span>	he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad
<span id="L5396" class="ln">  5396</span>	at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
<span id="L5397" class="ln">  5397</span>	lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted
<span id="L5398" class="ln">  5398</span>	listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
<span id="L5399" class="ln">  5399</span>	juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
<span id="L5400" class="ln">  5400</span>	victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
<span id="L5401" class="ln">  5401</span>	stolen melon. Poor lads! they--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.
<span id="L5402" class="ln">  5402</span>	
<span id="L5403" class="ln">  5403</span>	
<span id="L5404" class="ln">  5404</span>	
<span id="L5405" class="ln">  5405</span>	CHAPTER XXIII
<span id="L5406" class="ln">  5406</span>	
<span id="L5407" class="ln">  5407</span>	AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder
<span id="L5408" class="ln">  5408</span>	trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village
<span id="L5409" class="ln">  5409</span>	talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to
<span id="L5410" class="ln">  5410</span>	the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and
<span id="L5411" class="ln">  5411</span>	fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his
<span id="L5412" class="ln">  5412</span>	hearing as &#34;feelers&#34;; he did not see how he could be suspected of
<span id="L5413" class="ln">  5413</span>	knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be
<span id="L5414" class="ln">  5414</span>	comfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver
<span id="L5415" class="ln">  5415</span>	all the time. He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him.
<span id="L5416" class="ln">  5416</span>	It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to
<span id="L5417" class="ln">  5417</span>	divide his burden of distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he
<span id="L5418" class="ln">  5418</span>	wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.
<span id="L5419" class="ln">  5419</span>	
<span id="L5420" class="ln">  5420</span>	&#34;Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?&#34;
<span id="L5421" class="ln">  5421</span>	
<span id="L5422" class="ln">  5422</span>	&#34;&#39;Bout what?&#34;
<span id="L5423" class="ln">  5423</span>	
<span id="L5424" class="ln">  5424</span>	&#34;You know what.&#34;
<span id="L5425" class="ln">  5425</span>	
<span id="L5426" class="ln">  5426</span>	&#34;Oh--&#39;course I haven&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L5427" class="ln">  5427</span>	
<span id="L5428" class="ln">  5428</span>	&#34;Never a word?&#34;
<span id="L5429" class="ln">  5429</span>	
<span id="L5430" class="ln">  5430</span>	&#34;Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?&#34;
<span id="L5431" class="ln">  5431</span>	
<span id="L5432" class="ln">  5432</span>	&#34;Well, I was afeard.&#34;
<span id="L5433" class="ln">  5433</span>	
<span id="L5434" class="ln">  5434</span>	&#34;Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn&#39;t be alive two days if that got found out.
<span id="L5435" class="ln">  5435</span>	YOU know that.&#34;
<span id="L5436" class="ln">  5436</span>	
<span id="L5437" class="ln">  5437</span>	Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:
<span id="L5438" class="ln">  5438</span>	
<span id="L5439" class="ln">  5439</span>	&#34;Huck, they couldn&#39;t anybody get you to tell, could they?&#34;
<span id="L5440" class="ln">  5440</span>	
<span id="L5441" class="ln">  5441</span>	&#34;Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me
<span id="L5442" class="ln">  5442</span>	they could get me to tell. They ain&#39;t no different way.&#34;
<span id="L5443" class="ln">  5443</span>	
<span id="L5444" class="ln">  5444</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s all right, then. I reckon we&#39;re safe as long as we keep
<span id="L5445" class="ln">  5445</span>	mum. But let&#39;s swear again, anyway. It&#39;s more surer.&#34;
<span id="L5446" class="ln">  5446</span>	
<span id="L5447" class="ln">  5447</span>	&#34;I&#39;m agreed.&#34;
<span id="L5448" class="ln">  5448</span>	
<span id="L5449" class="ln">  5449</span>	So they swore again with dread solemnities.
<span id="L5450" class="ln">  5450</span>	
<span id="L5451" class="ln">  5451</span>	&#34;What is the talk around, Huck? I&#39;ve heard a power of it.&#34;
<span id="L5452" class="ln">  5452</span>	
<span id="L5453" class="ln">  5453</span>	&#34;Talk? Well, it&#39;s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
<span id="L5454" class="ln">  5454</span>	time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so&#39;s I want to hide som&#39;ers.&#34;
<span id="L5455" class="ln">  5455</span>	
<span id="L5456" class="ln">  5456</span>	&#34;That&#39;s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he&#39;s a goner.
<span id="L5457" class="ln">  5457</span>	Don&#39;t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?&#34;
<span id="L5458" class="ln">  5458</span>	
<span id="L5459" class="ln">  5459</span>	&#34;Most always--most always. He ain&#39;t no account; but then he hain&#39;t
<span id="L5460" class="ln">  5460</span>	ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money
<span id="L5461" class="ln">  5461</span>	to get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
<span id="L5462" class="ln">  5462</span>	that--leastways most of us--preachers and such like. But he&#39;s kind of
<span id="L5463" class="ln">  5463</span>	good--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn&#39;t enough for two;
<span id="L5464" class="ln">  5464</span>	and lots of times he&#39;s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.&#34;
<span id="L5465" class="ln">  5465</span>	
<span id="L5466" class="ln">  5466</span>	&#34;Well, he&#39;s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my
<span id="L5467" class="ln">  5467</span>	line. I wish we could get him out of there.&#34;
<span id="L5468" class="ln">  5468</span>	
<span id="L5469" class="ln">  5469</span>	&#34;My! we couldn&#39;t get him out, Tom. And besides, &#39;twouldn&#39;t do any
<span id="L5470" class="ln">  5470</span>	good; they&#39;d ketch him again.&#34;
<span id="L5471" class="ln">  5471</span>	
<span id="L5472" class="ln">  5472</span>	&#34;Yes--so they would. But I hate to hear &#39;em abuse him so like the
<span id="L5473" class="ln">  5473</span>	dickens when he never done--that.&#34;
<span id="L5474" class="ln">  5474</span>	
<span id="L5475" class="ln">  5475</span>	&#34;I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear &#39;em say he&#39;s the bloodiest looking
<span id="L5476" class="ln">  5476</span>	villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn&#39;t ever hung before.&#34;
<span id="L5477" class="ln">  5477</span>	
<span id="L5478" class="ln">  5478</span>	&#34;Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I&#39;ve heard &#39;em say that if he
<span id="L5479" class="ln">  5479</span>	was to get free they&#39;d lynch him.&#34;
<span id="L5480" class="ln">  5480</span>	
<span id="L5481" class="ln">  5481</span>	&#34;And they&#39;d do it, too.&#34;
<span id="L5482" class="ln">  5482</span>	
<span id="L5483" class="ln">  5483</span>	The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the
<span id="L5484" class="ln">  5484</span>	twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
<span id="L5485" class="ln">  5485</span>	of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that
<span id="L5486" class="ln">  5486</span>	something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But
<span id="L5487" class="ln">  5487</span>	nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
<span id="L5488" class="ln">  5488</span>	this luckless captive.
<span id="L5489" class="ln">  5489</span>	
<span id="L5490" class="ln">  5490</span>	The boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating
<span id="L5491" class="ln">  5491</span>	and gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor
<span id="L5492" class="ln">  5492</span>	and there were no guards.
<span id="L5493" class="ln">  5493</span>	
<span id="L5494" class="ln">  5494</span>	His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
<span id="L5495" class="ln">  5495</span>	before--it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and
<span id="L5496" class="ln">  5496</span>	treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:
<span id="L5497" class="ln">  5497</span>	
<span id="L5498" class="ln">  5498</span>	&#34;You&#39;ve been mighty good to me, boys--better&#39;n anybody else in this
<span id="L5499" class="ln">  5499</span>	town. And I don&#39;t forget it, I don&#39;t. Often I says to myself, says I,
<span id="L5500" class="ln">  5500</span>	&#39;I used to mend all the boys&#39; kites and things, and show &#39;em where the
<span id="L5501" class="ln">  5501</span>	good fishin&#39; places was, and befriend &#39;em what I could, and now they&#39;ve
<span id="L5502" class="ln">  5502</span>	all forgot old Muff when he&#39;s in trouble; but Tom don&#39;t, and Huck
<span id="L5503" class="ln">  5503</span>	don&#39;t--THEY don&#39;t forget him, says I, &#39;and I don&#39;t forget them.&#39; Well,
<span id="L5504" class="ln">  5504</span>	boys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that&#39;s the
<span id="L5505" class="ln">  5505</span>	only way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it&#39;s
<span id="L5506" class="ln">  5506</span>	right. Right, and BEST, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway. Well, we won&#39;t
<span id="L5507" class="ln">  5507</span>	talk about that. I don&#39;t want to make YOU feel bad; you&#39;ve befriended
<span id="L5508" class="ln">  5508</span>	me. But what I want to say, is, don&#39;t YOU ever get drunk--then you won&#39;t
<span id="L5509" class="ln">  5509</span>	ever get here. Stand a litter furder west--so--that&#39;s it; it&#39;s a prime
<span id="L5510" class="ln">  5510</span>	comfort to see faces that&#39;s friendly when a body&#39;s in such a muck of
<span id="L5511" class="ln">  5511</span>	trouble, and there don&#39;t none come here but yourn. Good friendly
<span id="L5512" class="ln">  5512</span>	faces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another&#39;s backs and let me
<span id="L5513" class="ln">  5513</span>	touch &#39;em. That&#39;s it. Shake hands--yourn&#39;ll come through the bars, but
<span id="L5514" class="ln">  5514</span>	mine&#39;s too big. Little hands, and weak--but they&#39;ve helped Muff Potter
<span id="L5515" class="ln">  5515</span>	a power, and they&#39;d help him more if they could.&#34;
<span id="L5516" class="ln">  5516</span>	
<span id="L5517" class="ln">  5517</span>	Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of
<span id="L5518" class="ln">  5518</span>	horrors. The next day and the day after, he hung about the court-room,
<span id="L5519" class="ln">  5519</span>	drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself
<span id="L5520" class="ln">  5520</span>	to stay out. Huck was having the same experience. They studiously
<span id="L5521" class="ln">  5521</span>	avoided each other. Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same
<span id="L5522" class="ln">  5522</span>	dismal fascination always brought them back presently. Tom kept his
<span id="L5523" class="ln">  5523</span>	ears open when idlers sauntered out of the court-room, but invariably
<span id="L5524" class="ln">  5524</span>	heard distressing news--the toils were closing more and more
<span id="L5525" class="ln">  5525</span>	relentlessly around poor Potter. At the end of the second day the
<span id="L5526" class="ln">  5526</span>	village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe&#39;s evidence stood firm and
<span id="L5527" class="ln">  5527</span>	unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to what the
<span id="L5528" class="ln">  5528</span>	jury&#39;s verdict would be.
<span id="L5529" class="ln">  5529</span>	
<span id="L5530" class="ln">  5530</span>	Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He
<span id="L5531" class="ln">  5531</span>	was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to
<span id="L5532" class="ln">  5532</span>	sleep. All the village flocked to the court-house the next morning, for
<span id="L5533" class="ln">  5533</span>	this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented
<span id="L5534" class="ln">  5534</span>	in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took
<span id="L5535" class="ln">  5535</span>	their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and
<span id="L5536" class="ln">  5536</span>	hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
<span id="L5537" class="ln">  5537</span>	the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,
<span id="L5538" class="ln">  5538</span>	stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
<span id="L5539" class="ln">  5539</span>	the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings
<span id="L5540" class="ln">  5540</span>	among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
<span id="L5541" class="ln">  5541</span>	details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
<span id="L5542" class="ln">  5542</span>	that was as impressive as it was fascinating.
<span id="L5543" class="ln">  5543</span>	
<span id="L5544" class="ln">  5544</span>	Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter
<span id="L5545" class="ln">  5545</span>	washing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder
<span id="L5546" class="ln">  5546</span>	was discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some
<span id="L5547" class="ln">  5547</span>	further questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:
<span id="L5548" class="ln">  5548</span>	
<span id="L5549" class="ln">  5549</span>	&#34;Take the witness.&#34;
<span id="L5550" class="ln">  5550</span>	
<span id="L5551" class="ln">  5551</span>	The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
<span id="L5552" class="ln">  5552</span>	his own counsel said:
<span id="L5553" class="ln">  5553</span>	
<span id="L5554" class="ln">  5554</span>	&#34;I have no questions to ask him.&#34;
<span id="L5555" class="ln">  5555</span>	
<span id="L5556" class="ln">  5556</span>	The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.
<span id="L5557" class="ln">  5557</span>	Counsel for the prosecution said:
<span id="L5558" class="ln">  5558</span>	
<span id="L5559" class="ln">  5559</span>	&#34;Take the witness.&#34;
<span id="L5560" class="ln">  5560</span>	
<span id="L5561" class="ln">  5561</span>	&#34;I have no questions to ask him,&#34; Potter&#39;s lawyer replied.
<span id="L5562" class="ln">  5562</span>	
<span id="L5563" class="ln">  5563</span>	A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter&#39;s
<span id="L5564" class="ln">  5564</span>	possession.
<span id="L5565" class="ln">  5565</span>	
<span id="L5566" class="ln">  5566</span>	&#34;Take the witness.&#34;
<span id="L5567" class="ln">  5567</span>	
<span id="L5568" class="ln">  5568</span>	Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience
<span id="L5569" class="ln">  5569</span>	began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his
<span id="L5570" class="ln">  5570</span>	client&#39;s life without an effort?
<span id="L5571" class="ln">  5571</span>	
<span id="L5572" class="ln">  5572</span>	Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter&#39;s guilty behavior when
<span id="L5573" class="ln">  5573</span>	brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the
<span id="L5574" class="ln">  5574</span>	stand without being cross-questioned.
<span id="L5575" class="ln">  5575</span>	
<span id="L5576" class="ln">  5576</span>	Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
<span id="L5577" class="ln">  5577</span>	graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
<span id="L5578" class="ln">  5578</span>	brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined
<span id="L5579" class="ln">  5579</span>	by Potter&#39;s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
<span id="L5580" class="ln">  5580</span>	expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.
<span id="L5581" class="ln">  5581</span>	Counsel for the prosecution now said:
<span id="L5582" class="ln">  5582</span>	
<span id="L5583" class="ln">  5583</span>	&#34;By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we
<span id="L5584" class="ln">  5584</span>	have fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question,
<span id="L5585" class="ln">  5585</span>	upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.&#34;
<span id="L5586" class="ln">  5586</span>	
<span id="L5587" class="ln">  5587</span>	A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
<span id="L5588" class="ln">  5588</span>	rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in
<span id="L5589" class="ln">  5589</span>	the court-room. Many men were moved, and many women&#39;s compassion
<span id="L5590" class="ln">  5590</span>	testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:
<span id="L5591" class="ln">  5591</span>	
<span id="L5592" class="ln">  5592</span>	&#34;Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
<span id="L5593" class="ln">  5593</span>	foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
<span id="L5594" class="ln">  5594</span>	while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium
<span id="L5595" class="ln">  5595</span>	produced by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that
<span id="L5596" class="ln">  5596</span>	plea.&#34; [Then to the clerk:] &#34;Call Thomas Sawyer!&#34;
<span id="L5597" class="ln">  5597</span>	
<span id="L5598" class="ln">  5598</span>	A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even
<span id="L5599" class="ln">  5599</span>	excepting Potter&#39;s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest
<span id="L5600" class="ln">  5600</span>	upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked
<span id="L5601" class="ln">  5601</span>	wild enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.
<span id="L5602" class="ln">  5602</span>	
<span id="L5603" class="ln">  5603</span>	&#34;Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
<span id="L5604" class="ln">  5604</span>	hour of midnight?&#34;
<span id="L5605" class="ln">  5605</span>	
<span id="L5606" class="ln">  5606</span>	Tom glanced at Injun Joe&#39;s iron face and his tongue failed him. The
<span id="L5607" class="ln">  5607</span>	audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a
<span id="L5608" class="ln">  5608</span>	few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and
<span id="L5609" class="ln">  5609</span>	managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house
<span id="L5610" class="ln">  5610</span>	hear:
<span id="L5611" class="ln">  5611</span>	
<span id="L5612" class="ln">  5612</span>	&#34;In the graveyard!&#34;
<span id="L5613" class="ln">  5613</span>	
<span id="L5614" class="ln">  5614</span>	&#34;A little bit louder, please. Don&#39;t be afraid. You were--&#34;
<span id="L5615" class="ln">  5615</span>	
<span id="L5616" class="ln">  5616</span>	&#34;In the graveyard.&#34;
<span id="L5617" class="ln">  5617</span>	
<span id="L5618" class="ln">  5618</span>	A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe&#39;s face.
<span id="L5619" class="ln">  5619</span>	
<span id="L5620" class="ln">  5620</span>	&#34;Were you anywhere near Horse Williams&#39; grave?&#34;
<span id="L5621" class="ln">  5621</span>	
<span id="L5622" class="ln">  5622</span>	&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;
<span id="L5623" class="ln">  5623</span>	
<span id="L5624" class="ln">  5624</span>	&#34;Speak up--just a trifle louder. How near were you?&#34;
<span id="L5625" class="ln">  5625</span>	
<span id="L5626" class="ln">  5626</span>	&#34;Near as I am to you.&#34;
<span id="L5627" class="ln">  5627</span>	
<span id="L5628" class="ln">  5628</span>	&#34;Were you hidden, or not?&#34;
<span id="L5629" class="ln">  5629</span>	
<span id="L5630" class="ln">  5630</span>	&#34;I was hid.&#34;
<span id="L5631" class="ln">  5631</span>	
<span id="L5632" class="ln">  5632</span>	&#34;Where?&#34;
<span id="L5633" class="ln">  5633</span>	
<span id="L5634" class="ln">  5634</span>	&#34;Behind the elms that&#39;s on the edge of the grave.&#34;
<span id="L5635" class="ln">  5635</span>	
<span id="L5636" class="ln">  5636</span>	Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.
<span id="L5637" class="ln">  5637</span>	
<span id="L5638" class="ln">  5638</span>	&#34;Any one with you?&#34;
<span id="L5639" class="ln">  5639</span>	
<span id="L5640" class="ln">  5640</span>	&#34;Yes, sir. I went there with--&#34;
<span id="L5641" class="ln">  5641</span>	
<span id="L5642" class="ln">  5642</span>	&#34;Wait--wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion&#39;s name. We
<span id="L5643" class="ln">  5643</span>	will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with
<span id="L5644" class="ln">  5644</span>	you.&#34;
<span id="L5645" class="ln">  5645</span>	
<span id="L5646" class="ln">  5646</span>	Tom hesitated and looked confused.
<span id="L5647" class="ln">  5647</span>	
<span id="L5648" class="ln">  5648</span>	&#34;Speak out, my boy--don&#39;t be diffident. The truth is always
<span id="L5649" class="ln">  5649</span>	respectable. What did you take there?&#34;
<span id="L5650" class="ln">  5650</span>	
<span id="L5651" class="ln">  5651</span>	&#34;Only a--a--dead cat.&#34;
<span id="L5652" class="ln">  5652</span>	
<span id="L5653" class="ln">  5653</span>	There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
<span id="L5654" class="ln">  5654</span>	
<span id="L5655" class="ln">  5655</span>	&#34;We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
<span id="L5656" class="ln">  5656</span>	everything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don&#39;t skip anything,
<span id="L5657" class="ln">  5657</span>	and don&#39;t be afraid.&#34;
<span id="L5658" class="ln">  5658</span>	
<span id="L5659" class="ln">  5659</span>	Tom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
<span id="L5660" class="ln">  5660</span>	words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
<span id="L5661" class="ln">  5661</span>	but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips
<span id="L5662" class="ln">  5662</span>	and bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of
<span id="L5663" class="ln">  5663</span>	time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon
<span id="L5664" class="ln">  5664</span>	pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said:
<span id="L5665" class="ln">  5665</span>	
<span id="L5666" class="ln">  5666</span>	&#34;--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell,
<span id="L5667" class="ln">  5667</span>	Injun Joe jumped with the knife and--&#34;
<span id="L5668" class="ln">  5668</span>	
<span id="L5669" class="ln">  5669</span>	Crash! Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his
<span id="L5670" class="ln">  5670</span>	way through all opposers, and was gone!
<span id="L5671" class="ln">  5671</span>	
<span id="L5672" class="ln">  5672</span>	
<span id="L5673" class="ln">  5673</span>	
<span id="L5674" class="ln">  5674</span>	CHAPTER XXIV
<span id="L5675" class="ln">  5675</span>	
<span id="L5676" class="ln">  5676</span>	TOM was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of
<span id="L5677" class="ln">  5677</span>	the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village
<span id="L5678" class="ln">  5678</span>	paper magnified him. There were some that believed he would be
<span id="L5679" class="ln">  5679</span>	President, yet, if he escaped hanging.
<span id="L5680" class="ln">  5680</span>	
<span id="L5681" class="ln">  5681</span>	As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
<span id="L5682" class="ln">  5682</span>	and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort
<span id="L5683" class="ln">  5683</span>	of conduct is to the world&#39;s credit; therefore it is not well to find
<span id="L5684" class="ln">  5684</span>	fault with it.
<span id="L5685" class="ln">  5685</span>	
<span id="L5686" class="ln">  5686</span>	Tom&#39;s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
<span id="L5687" class="ln">  5687</span>	were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
<span id="L5688" class="ln">  5688</span>	with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to
<span id="L5689" class="ln">  5689</span>	stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of
<span id="L5690" class="ln">  5690</span>	wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
<span id="L5691" class="ln">  5691</span>	the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid
<span id="L5692" class="ln">  5692</span>	that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
<span id="L5693" class="ln">  5693</span>	Injun Joe&#39;s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
<span id="L5694" class="ln">  5694</span>	The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
<span id="L5695" class="ln">  5695</span>	that? Since Tom&#39;s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
<span id="L5696" class="ln">  5696</span>	lawyer&#39;s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been
<span id="L5697" class="ln">  5697</span>	sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck&#39;s
<span id="L5698" class="ln">  5698</span>	confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.
<span id="L5699" class="ln">  5699</span>	
<span id="L5700" class="ln">  5700</span>	Daily Muff Potter&#39;s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
<span id="L5701" class="ln">  5701</span>	he wished he had sealed up his tongue.
<span id="L5702" class="ln">  5702</span>	
<span id="L5703" class="ln">  5703</span>	Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the
<span id="L5704" class="ln">  5704</span>	other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw
<span id="L5705" class="ln">  5705</span>	a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.
<span id="L5706" class="ln">  5706</span>	
<span id="L5707" class="ln">  5707</span>	Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun
<span id="L5708" class="ln">  5708</span>	Joe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a
<span id="L5709" class="ln">  5709</span>	detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head,
<span id="L5710" class="ln">  5710</span>	looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of
<span id="L5711" class="ln">  5711</span>	that craft usually achieve. That is to say, he &#34;found a clew.&#34; But you
<span id="L5712" class="ln">  5712</span>	can&#39;t hang a &#34;clew&#34; for murder, and so after that detective had got
<span id="L5713" class="ln">  5713</span>	through and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.
<span id="L5714" class="ln">  5714</span>	
<span id="L5715" class="ln">  5715</span>	The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
<span id="L5716" class="ln">  5716</span>	weight of apprehension.
<span id="L5717" class="ln">  5717</span>	
<span id="L5718" class="ln">  5718</span>

<span id="L5720" class="ln">  5720</span>	CHAPTER XXV
<span id="L5721" class="ln">  5721</span>	
<span id="L5722" class="ln">  5722</span>	THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy&#39;s life when he has
<span id="L5723" class="ln">  5723</span>	a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This
<span id="L5724" class="ln">  5724</span>	desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe
<span id="L5725" class="ln">  5725</span>	Harper, but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone
<span id="L5726" class="ln">  5726</span>	fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck
<span id="L5727" class="ln">  5727</span>	would answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to
<span id="L5728" class="ln">  5728</span>	him confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a
<span id="L5729" class="ln">  5729</span>	hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no
<span id="L5730" class="ln">  5730</span>	capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time
<span id="L5731" class="ln">  5731</span>	which is not money. &#34;Where&#39;ll we dig?&#34; said Huck.
<span id="L5732" class="ln">  5732</span>	
<span id="L5733" class="ln">  5733</span>	&#34;Oh, most anywhere.&#34;
<span id="L5734" class="ln">  5734</span>	
<span id="L5735" class="ln">  5735</span>	&#34;Why, is it hid all around?&#34;
<span id="L5736" class="ln">  5736</span>	
<span id="L5737" class="ln">  5737</span>	&#34;No, indeed it ain&#39;t. It&#39;s hid in mighty particular places, Huck
<span id="L5738" class="ln">  5738</span>	--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a
<span id="L5739" class="ln">  5739</span>	limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but
<span id="L5740" class="ln">  5740</span>	mostly under the floor in ha&#39;nted houses.&#34;
<span id="L5741" class="ln">  5741</span>	
<span id="L5742" class="ln">  5742</span>	&#34;Who hides it?&#34;
<span id="L5743" class="ln">  5743</span>	
<span id="L5744" class="ln">  5744</span>	&#34;Why, robbers, of course--who&#39;d you reckon? Sunday-school
<span id="L5745" class="ln">  5745</span>	sup&#39;rintendents?&#34;
<span id="L5746" class="ln">  5746</span>	
<span id="L5747" class="ln">  5747</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t know. If &#39;twas mine I wouldn&#39;t hide it; I&#39;d spend it and have
<span id="L5748" class="ln">  5748</span>	a good time.&#34;
<span id="L5749" class="ln">  5749</span>	
<span id="L5750" class="ln">  5750</span>	&#34;So would I. But robbers don&#39;t do that way. They always hide it and
<span id="L5751" class="ln">  5751</span>	leave it there.&#34;
<span id="L5752" class="ln">  5752</span>	
<span id="L5753" class="ln">  5753</span>	&#34;Don&#39;t they come after it any more?&#34;
<span id="L5754" class="ln">  5754</span>	
<span id="L5755" class="ln">  5755</span>	&#34;No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or
<span id="L5756" class="ln">  5756</span>	else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by
<span id="L5757" class="ln">  5757</span>	and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the
<span id="L5758" class="ln">  5758</span>	marks--a paper that&#39;s got to be ciphered over about a week because it&#39;s
<span id="L5759" class="ln">  5759</span>	mostly signs and hy&#39;roglyphics.&#34;
<span id="L5760" class="ln">  5760</span>	
<span id="L5761" class="ln">  5761</span>	&#34;Hyro--which?&#34;
<span id="L5762" class="ln">  5762</span>	
<span id="L5763" class="ln">  5763</span>	&#34;Hy&#39;roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don&#39;t seem to mean
<span id="L5764" class="ln">  5764</span>	anything.&#34;
<span id="L5765" class="ln">  5765</span>	
<span id="L5766" class="ln">  5766</span>	&#34;Have you got one of them papers, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L5767" class="ln">  5767</span>	
<span id="L5768" class="ln">  5768</span>	&#34;No.&#34;
<span id="L5769" class="ln">  5769</span>	
<span id="L5770" class="ln">  5770</span>	&#34;Well then, how you going to find the marks?&#34;
<span id="L5771" class="ln">  5771</span>	
<span id="L5772" class="ln">  5772</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha&#39;nted house or
<span id="L5773" class="ln">  5773</span>	on an island, or under a dead tree that&#39;s got one limb sticking out.
<span id="L5774" class="ln">  5774</span>	Well, we&#39;ve tried Jackson&#39;s Island a little, and we can try it again
<span id="L5775" class="ln">  5775</span>	some time; and there&#39;s the old ha&#39;nted house up the Still-House branch,
<span id="L5776" class="ln">  5776</span>	and there&#39;s lots of dead-limb trees--dead loads of &#39;em.&#34;
<span id="L5777" class="ln">  5777</span>	
<span id="L5778" class="ln">  5778</span>	&#34;Is it under all of them?&#34;
<span id="L5779" class="ln">  5779</span>	
<span id="L5780" class="ln">  5780</span>	&#34;How you talk! No!&#34;
<span id="L5781" class="ln">  5781</span>	
<span id="L5782" class="ln">  5782</span>	&#34;Then how you going to know which one to go for?&#34;
<span id="L5783" class="ln">  5783</span>	
<span id="L5784" class="ln">  5784</span>	&#34;Go for all of &#39;em!&#34;
<span id="L5785" class="ln">  5785</span>	
<span id="L5786" class="ln">  5786</span>	&#34;Why, Tom, it&#39;ll take all summer.&#34;
<span id="L5787" class="ln">  5787</span>	
<span id="L5788" class="ln">  5788</span>	&#34;Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred
<span id="L5789" class="ln">  5789</span>	dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di&#39;monds.
<span id="L5790" class="ln">  5790</span>	How&#39;s that?&#34;
<span id="L5791" class="ln">  5791</span>	
<span id="L5792" class="ln">  5792</span>	Huck&#39;s eyes glowed.
<span id="L5793" class="ln">  5793</span>	
<span id="L5794" class="ln">  5794</span>	&#34;That&#39;s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred
<span id="L5795" class="ln">  5795</span>	dollars and I don&#39;t want no di&#39;monds.&#34;
<span id="L5796" class="ln">  5796</span>	
<span id="L5797" class="ln">  5797</span>	&#34;All right. But I bet you I ain&#39;t going to throw off on di&#39;monds. Some
<span id="L5798" class="ln">  5798</span>	of &#39;em&#39;s worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain&#39;t any, hardly, but&#39;s
<span id="L5799" class="ln">  5799</span>	worth six bits or a dollar.&#34;
<span id="L5800" class="ln">  5800</span>	
<span id="L5801" class="ln">  5801</span>	&#34;No! Is that so?&#34;
<span id="L5802" class="ln">  5802</span>	
<span id="L5803" class="ln">  5803</span>	&#34;Cert&#39;nly--anybody&#39;ll tell you so. Hain&#39;t you ever seen one, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L5804" class="ln">  5804</span>	
<span id="L5805" class="ln">  5805</span>	&#34;Not as I remember.&#34;
<span id="L5806" class="ln">  5806</span>	
<span id="L5807" class="ln">  5807</span>	&#34;Oh, kings have slathers of them.&#34;
<span id="L5808" class="ln">  5808</span>	
<span id="L5809" class="ln">  5809</span>	&#34;Well, I don&#39; know no kings, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L5810" class="ln">  5810</span>	
<span id="L5811" class="ln">  5811</span>	&#34;I reckon you don&#39;t. But if you was to go to Europe you&#39;d see a raft
<span id="L5812" class="ln">  5812</span>	of &#39;em hopping around.&#34;
<span id="L5813" class="ln">  5813</span>	
<span id="L5814" class="ln">  5814</span>	&#34;Do they hop?&#34;
<span id="L5815" class="ln">  5815</span>	
<span id="L5816" class="ln">  5816</span>	&#34;Hop?--your granny! No!&#34;
<span id="L5817" class="ln">  5817</span>	
<span id="L5818" class="ln">  5818</span>	&#34;Well, what did you say they did, for?&#34;
<span id="L5819" class="ln">  5819</span>	
<span id="L5820" class="ln">  5820</span>	&#34;Shucks, I only meant you&#39;d SEE &#39;em--not hopping, of course--what do
<span id="L5821" class="ln">  5821</span>	they want to hop for?--but I mean you&#39;d just see &#39;em--scattered around,
<span id="L5822" class="ln">  5822</span>	you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.&#34;
<span id="L5823" class="ln">  5823</span>	
<span id="L5824" class="ln">  5824</span>	&#34;Richard? What&#39;s his other name?&#34;
<span id="L5825" class="ln">  5825</span>	
<span id="L5826" class="ln">  5826</span>	&#34;He didn&#39;t have any other name. Kings don&#39;t have any but a given name.&#34;
<span id="L5827" class="ln">  5827</span>	
<span id="L5828" class="ln">  5828</span>	&#34;No?&#34;
<span id="L5829" class="ln">  5829</span>	
<span id="L5830" class="ln">  5830</span>	&#34;But they don&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L5831" class="ln">  5831</span>	
<span id="L5832" class="ln">  5832</span>	&#34;Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don&#39;t want to be a king
<span id="L5833" class="ln">  5833</span>	and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you
<span id="L5834" class="ln">  5834</span>	going to dig first?&#34;
<span id="L5835" class="ln">  5835</span>	
<span id="L5836" class="ln">  5836</span>	&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know. S&#39;pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the
<span id="L5837" class="ln">  5837</span>	hill t&#39;other side of Still-House branch?&#34;
<span id="L5838" class="ln">  5838</span>	
<span id="L5839" class="ln">  5839</span>	&#34;I&#39;m agreed.&#34;
<span id="L5840" class="ln">  5840</span>	
<span id="L5841" class="ln">  5841</span>	So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their
<span id="L5842" class="ln">  5842</span>	three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves
<span id="L5843" class="ln">  5843</span>	down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.
<span id="L5844" class="ln">  5844</span>	
<span id="L5845" class="ln">  5845</span>	&#34;I like this,&#34; said Tom.
<span id="L5846" class="ln">  5846</span>	
<span id="L5847" class="ln">  5847</span>	&#34;So do I.&#34;
<span id="L5848" class="ln">  5848</span>	
<span id="L5849" class="ln">  5849</span>	&#34;Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your
<span id="L5850" class="ln">  5850</span>	share?&#34;
<span id="L5851" class="ln">  5851</span>	
<span id="L5852" class="ln">  5852</span>	&#34;Well, I&#39;ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I&#39;ll go to
<span id="L5853" class="ln">  5853</span>	every circus that comes along. I bet I&#39;ll have a gay time.&#34;
<span id="L5854" class="ln">  5854</span>	
<span id="L5855" class="ln">  5855</span>	&#34;Well, ain&#39;t you going to save any of it?&#34;
<span id="L5856" class="ln">  5856</span>	
<span id="L5857" class="ln">  5857</span>	&#34;Save it? What for?&#34;
<span id="L5858" class="ln">  5858</span>	
<span id="L5859" class="ln">  5859</span>	&#34;Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.&#34;
<span id="L5860" class="ln">  5860</span>	
<span id="L5861" class="ln">  5861</span>	&#34;Oh, that ain&#39;t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some
<span id="L5862" class="ln">  5862</span>	day and get his claws on it if I didn&#39;t hurry up, and I tell you he&#39;d
<span id="L5863" class="ln">  5863</span>	clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L5864" class="ln">  5864</span>	
<span id="L5865" class="ln">  5865</span>	&#34;I&#39;m going to buy a new drum, and a sure-&#39;nough sword, and a red
<span id="L5866" class="ln">  5866</span>	necktie and a bull pup, and get married.&#34;
<span id="L5867" class="ln">  5867</span>	
<span id="L5868" class="ln">  5868</span>	&#34;Married!&#34;
<span id="L5869" class="ln">  5869</span>	
<span id="L5870" class="ln">  5870</span>	&#34;That&#39;s it.&#34;
<span id="L5871" class="ln">  5871</span>	
<span id="L5872" class="ln">  5872</span>	&#34;Tom, you--why, you ain&#39;t in your right mind.&#34;
<span id="L5873" class="ln">  5873</span>	
<span id="L5874" class="ln">  5874</span>	&#34;Wait--you&#39;ll see.&#34;
<span id="L5875" class="ln">  5875</span>	
<span id="L5876" class="ln">  5876</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my
<span id="L5877" class="ln">  5877</span>	mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty
<span id="L5878" class="ln">  5878</span>	well.&#34;
<span id="L5879" class="ln">  5879</span>	
<span id="L5880" class="ln">  5880</span>	&#34;That ain&#39;t anything. The girl I&#39;m going to marry won&#39;t fight.&#34;
<span id="L5881" class="ln">  5881</span>	
<span id="L5882" class="ln">  5882</span>	&#34;Tom, I reckon they&#39;re all alike. They&#39;ll all comb a body. Now you
<span id="L5883" class="ln">  5883</span>	better think &#39;bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What&#39;s the name
<span id="L5884" class="ln">  5884</span>	of the gal?&#34;
<span id="L5885" class="ln">  5885</span>	
<span id="L5886" class="ln">  5886</span>	&#34;It ain&#39;t a gal at all--it&#39;s a girl.&#34;
<span id="L5887" class="ln">  5887</span>	
<span id="L5888" class="ln">  5888</span>	&#34;It&#39;s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both&#39;s
<span id="L5889" class="ln">  5889</span>	right, like enough. Anyway, what&#39;s her name, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L5890" class="ln">  5890</span>	
<span id="L5891" class="ln">  5891</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll tell you some time--not now.&#34;
<span id="L5892" class="ln">  5892</span>	
<span id="L5893" class="ln">  5893</span>	&#34;All right--that&#39;ll do. Only if you get married I&#39;ll be more lonesomer
<span id="L5894" class="ln">  5894</span>	than ever.&#34;
<span id="L5895" class="ln">  5895</span>	
<span id="L5896" class="ln">  5896</span>	&#34;No you won&#39;t. You&#39;ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and
<span id="L5897" class="ln">  5897</span>	we&#39;ll go to digging.&#34;
<span id="L5898" class="ln">  5898</span>	
<span id="L5899" class="ln">  5899</span>	They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled
<span id="L5900" class="ln">  5900</span>	another half-hour. Still no result. Huck said:
<span id="L5901" class="ln">  5901</span>	
<span id="L5902" class="ln">  5902</span>	&#34;Do they always bury it as deep as this?&#34;
<span id="L5903" class="ln">  5903</span>	
<span id="L5904" class="ln">  5904</span>	&#34;Sometimes--not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven&#39;t got the
<span id="L5905" class="ln">  5905</span>	right place.&#34;
<span id="L5906" class="ln">  5906</span>	
<span id="L5907" class="ln">  5907</span>	So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,
<span id="L5908" class="ln">  5908</span>	but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some
<span id="L5909" class="ln">  5909</span>	time. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from
<span id="L5910" class="ln">  5910</span>	his brow with his sleeve, and said:
<span id="L5911" class="ln">  5911</span>	
<span id="L5912" class="ln">  5912</span>	&#34;Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?&#34;
<span id="L5913" class="ln">  5913</span>	
<span id="L5914" class="ln">  5914</span>	&#34;I reckon maybe we&#39;ll tackle the old tree that&#39;s over yonder on
<span id="L5915" class="ln">  5915</span>	Cardiff Hill back of the widow&#39;s.&#34;
<span id="L5916" class="ln">  5916</span>	
<span id="L5917" class="ln">  5917</span>	&#34;I reckon that&#39;ll be a good one. But won&#39;t the widow take it away from
<span id="L5918" class="ln">  5918</span>	us, Tom? It&#39;s on her land.&#34;
<span id="L5919" class="ln">  5919</span>	
<span id="L5920" class="ln">  5920</span>	&#34;SHE take it away! Maybe she&#39;d like to try it once. Whoever finds one
<span id="L5921" class="ln">  5921</span>	of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don&#39;t make any difference
<span id="L5922" class="ln">  5922</span>	whose land it&#39;s on.&#34;
<span id="L5923" class="ln">  5923</span>	
<span id="L5924" class="ln">  5924</span>	That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:
<span id="L5925" class="ln">  5925</span>	
<span id="L5926" class="ln">  5926</span>	&#34;Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?&#34;
<span id="L5927" class="ln">  5927</span>	
<span id="L5928" class="ln">  5928</span>	&#34;It is mighty curious, Huck. I don&#39;t understand it. Sometimes witches
<span id="L5929" class="ln">  5929</span>	interfere. I reckon maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s the trouble now.&#34;
<span id="L5930" class="ln">  5930</span>	
<span id="L5931" class="ln">  5931</span>	&#34;Shucks! Witches ain&#39;t got no power in the daytime.&#34;
<span id="L5932" class="ln">  5932</span>	
<span id="L5933" class="ln">  5933</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s so. I didn&#39;t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter
<span id="L5934" class="ln">  5934</span>	is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the
<span id="L5935" class="ln">  5935</span>	shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that&#39;s where you dig!&#34;
<span id="L5936" class="ln">  5936</span>	
<span id="L5937" class="ln">  5937</span>	&#34;Then consound it, we&#39;ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now
<span id="L5938" class="ln">  5938</span>	hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It&#39;s an awful long way.
<span id="L5939" class="ln">  5939</span>	Can you get out?&#34;
<span id="L5940" class="ln">  5940</span>	
<span id="L5941" class="ln">  5941</span>	&#34;I bet I will. We&#39;ve got to do it to-night, too, because if somebody
<span id="L5942" class="ln">  5942</span>	sees these holes they&#39;ll know in a minute what&#39;s here and they&#39;ll go
<span id="L5943" class="ln">  5943</span>	for it.&#34;
<span id="L5944" class="ln">  5944</span>	
<span id="L5945" class="ln">  5945</span>	&#34;Well, I&#39;ll come around and maow to-night.&#34;
<span id="L5946" class="ln">  5946</span>	
<span id="L5947" class="ln">  5947</span>	&#34;All right. Let&#39;s hide the tools in the bushes.&#34;
<span id="L5948" class="ln">  5948</span>	
<span id="L5949" class="ln">  5949</span>	The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in
<span id="L5950" class="ln">  5950</span>	the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by
<span id="L5951" class="ln">  5951</span>	old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked
<span id="L5952" class="ln">  5952</span>	in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
<span id="L5953" class="ln">  5953</span>	distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were
<span id="L5954" class="ln">  5954</span>	subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged
<span id="L5955" class="ln">  5955</span>	that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to
<span id="L5956" class="ln">  5956</span>	dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and
<span id="L5957" class="ln">  5957</span>	their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,
<span id="L5958" class="ln">  5958</span>	but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
<span id="L5959" class="ln">  5959</span>	something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone
<span id="L5960" class="ln">  5960</span>	or a chunk. At last Tom said:
<span id="L5961" class="ln">  5961</span>	
<span id="L5962" class="ln">  5962</span>	&#34;It ain&#39;t any use, Huck, we&#39;re wrong again.&#34;
<span id="L5963" class="ln">  5963</span>	
<span id="L5964" class="ln">  5964</span>	&#34;Well, but we CAN&#39;T be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.&#34;
<span id="L5965" class="ln">  5965</span>	
<span id="L5966" class="ln">  5966</span>	&#34;I know it, but then there&#39;s another thing.&#34;
<span id="L5967" class="ln">  5967</span>	
<span id="L5968" class="ln">  5968</span>	&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;.
<span id="L5969" class="ln">  5969</span>	
<span id="L5970" class="ln">  5970</span>	&#34;Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too
<span id="L5971" class="ln">  5971</span>	early.&#34;
<span id="L5972" class="ln">  5972</span>	
<span id="L5973" class="ln">  5973</span>	Huck dropped his shovel.
<span id="L5974" class="ln">  5974</span>	
<span id="L5975" class="ln">  5975</span>	&#34;That&#39;s it,&#34; said he. &#34;That&#39;s the very trouble. We got to give this
<span id="L5976" class="ln">  5976</span>	one up. We can&#39;t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of
<span id="L5977" class="ln">  5977</span>	thing&#39;s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts
<span id="L5978" class="ln">  5978</span>	a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something&#39;s behind me all the time;
<span id="L5979" class="ln">  5979</span>	and I&#39;m afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there&#39;s others in front
<span id="L5980" class="ln">  5980</span>	a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.&#34;
<span id="L5981" class="ln">  5981</span>	
<span id="L5982" class="ln">  5982</span>	&#34;Well, I&#39;ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a
<span id="L5983" class="ln">  5983</span>	dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.&#34;
<span id="L5984" class="ln">  5984</span>	
<span id="L5985" class="ln">  5985</span>	&#34;Lordy!&#34;
<span id="L5986" class="ln">  5986</span>	
<span id="L5987" class="ln">  5987</span>	&#34;Yes, they do. I&#39;ve always heard that.&#34;
<span id="L5988" class="ln">  5988</span>	
<span id="L5989" class="ln">  5989</span>	&#34;Tom, I don&#39;t like to fool around much where there&#39;s dead people. A
<span id="L5990" class="ln">  5990</span>	body&#39;s bound to get into trouble with &#39;em, sure.&#34;
<span id="L5991" class="ln">  5991</span>	
<span id="L5992" class="ln">  5992</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t like to stir &#39;em up, either. S&#39;pose this one here was to
<span id="L5993" class="ln">  5993</span>	stick his skull out and say something!&#34;
<span id="L5994" class="ln">  5994</span>	
<span id="L5995" class="ln">  5995</span>	&#34;Don&#39;t Tom! It&#39;s awful.&#34;
<span id="L5996" class="ln">  5996</span>	
<span id="L5997" class="ln">  5997</span>	&#34;Well, it just is. Huck, I don&#39;t feel comfortable a bit.&#34;
<span id="L5998" class="ln">  5998</span>	
<span id="L5999" class="ln">  5999</span>	&#34;Say, Tom, let&#39;s give this place up, and try somewheres else.&#34;
<span id="L6000" class="ln">  6000</span>	
<span id="L6001" class="ln">  6001</span>	&#34;All right, I reckon we better.&#34;
<span id="L6002" class="ln">  6002</span>	
<span id="L6003" class="ln">  6003</span>	&#34;What&#39;ll it be?&#34;
<span id="L6004" class="ln">  6004</span>	
<span id="L6005" class="ln">  6005</span>	Tom considered awhile; and then said:
<span id="L6006" class="ln">  6006</span>	
<span id="L6007" class="ln">  6007</span>	&#34;The ha&#39;nted house. That&#39;s it!&#34;
<span id="L6008" class="ln">  6008</span>	
<span id="L6009" class="ln">  6009</span>	&#34;Blame it, I don&#39;t like ha&#39;nted houses, Tom. Why, they&#39;re a dern sight
<span id="L6010" class="ln">  6010</span>	worse&#39;n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don&#39;t come
<span id="L6011" class="ln">  6011</span>	sliding around in a shroud, when you ain&#39;t noticing, and peep over your
<span id="L6012" class="ln">  6012</span>	shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I
<span id="L6013" class="ln">  6013</span>	couldn&#39;t stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could.&#34;
<span id="L6014" class="ln">  6014</span>	
<span id="L6015" class="ln">  6015</span>	&#34;Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don&#39;t travel around only at night. They won&#39;t
<span id="L6016" class="ln">  6016</span>	hender us from digging there in the daytime.&#34;
<span id="L6017" class="ln">  6017</span>	
<span id="L6018" class="ln">  6018</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s so. But you know mighty well people don&#39;t go about that
<span id="L6019" class="ln">  6019</span>	ha&#39;nted house in the day nor the night.&#34;
<span id="L6020" class="ln">  6020</span>	
<span id="L6021" class="ln">  6021</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s mostly because they don&#39;t like to go where a man&#39;s been
<span id="L6022" class="ln">  6022</span>	murdered, anyway--but nothing&#39;s ever been seen around that house except
<span id="L6023" class="ln">  6023</span>	in the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular
<span id="L6024" class="ln">  6024</span>	ghosts.&#34;
<span id="L6025" class="ln">  6025</span>	
<span id="L6026" class="ln">  6026</span>	&#34;Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,
<span id="L6027" class="ln">  6027</span>	you can bet there&#39;s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to
<span id="L6028" class="ln">  6028</span>	reason. Becuz you know that they don&#39;t anybody but ghosts use &#39;em.&#34;
<span id="L6029" class="ln">  6029</span>	
<span id="L6030" class="ln">  6030</span>	&#34;Yes, that&#39;s so. But anyway they don&#39;t come around in the daytime, so
<span id="L6031" class="ln">  6031</span>	what&#39;s the use of our being afeard?&#34;
<span id="L6032" class="ln">  6032</span>	
<span id="L6033" class="ln">  6033</span>	&#34;Well, all right. We&#39;ll tackle the ha&#39;nted house if you say so--but I
<span id="L6034" class="ln">  6034</span>	reckon it&#39;s taking chances.&#34;
<span id="L6035" class="ln">  6035</span>	
<span id="L6036" class="ln">  6036</span>	They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of
<span id="L6037" class="ln">  6037</span>	the moonlit valley below them stood the &#34;ha&#39;nted&#34; house, utterly
<span id="L6038" class="ln">  6038</span>	isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very
<span id="L6039" class="ln">  6039</span>	doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a
<span id="L6040" class="ln">  6040</span>	corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to
<span id="L6041" class="ln">  6041</span>	see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a low tone, as
<span id="L6042" class="ln">  6042</span>	befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck far off to the
<span id="L6043" class="ln">  6043</span>	right, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and took their way
<span id="L6044" class="ln">  6044</span>	homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff
<span id="L6045" class="ln">  6045</span>	Hill.
<span id="L6046" class="ln">  6046</span>	
<span id="L6047" class="ln">  6047</span>	
<span id="L6048" class="ln">  6048</span>	
<span id="L6049" class="ln">  6049</span>	CHAPTER XXVI
<span id="L6050" class="ln">  6050</span>	
<span id="L6051" class="ln">  6051</span>	ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had
<span id="L6052" class="ln">  6052</span>	come for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house;
<span id="L6053" class="ln">  6053</span>	Huck was measurably so, also--but suddenly said:
<span id="L6054" class="ln">  6054</span>	
<span id="L6055" class="ln">  6055</span>	&#34;Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?&#34;
<span id="L6056" class="ln">  6056</span>	
<span id="L6057" class="ln">  6057</span>	Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted
<span id="L6058" class="ln">  6058</span>	his eyes with a startled look in them--
<span id="L6059" class="ln">  6059</span>	
<span id="L6060" class="ln">  6060</span>	&#34;My! I never once thought of it, Huck!&#34;
<span id="L6061" class="ln">  6061</span>	
<span id="L6062" class="ln">  6062</span>	&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was
<span id="L6063" class="ln">  6063</span>	Friday.&#34;
<span id="L6064" class="ln">  6064</span>	
<span id="L6065" class="ln">  6065</span>	&#34;Blame it, a body can&#39;t be too careful, Huck. We might &#39;a&#39; got into an
<span id="L6066" class="ln">  6066</span>	awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.&#34;
<span id="L6067" class="ln">  6067</span>	
<span id="L6068" class="ln">  6068</span>	&#34;MIGHT! Better say we WOULD! There&#39;s some lucky days, maybe, but
<span id="L6069" class="ln">  6069</span>	Friday ain&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L6070" class="ln">  6070</span>	
<span id="L6071" class="ln">  6071</span>	&#34;Any fool knows that. I don&#39;t reckon YOU was the first that found it
<span id="L6072" class="ln">  6072</span>	out, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L6073" class="ln">  6073</span>	
<span id="L6074" class="ln">  6074</span>	&#34;Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain&#39;t all, neither. I had
<span id="L6075" class="ln">  6075</span>	a rotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.&#34;
<span id="L6076" class="ln">  6076</span>	
<span id="L6077" class="ln">  6077</span>	&#34;No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?&#34;
<span id="L6078" class="ln">  6078</span>	
<span id="L6079" class="ln">  6079</span>	&#34;No.&#34;
<span id="L6080" class="ln">  6080</span>	
<span id="L6081" class="ln">  6081</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s good, Huck. When they don&#39;t fight it&#39;s only a sign that
<span id="L6082" class="ln">  6082</span>	there&#39;s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty
<span id="L6083" class="ln">  6083</span>	sharp and keep out of it. We&#39;ll drop this thing for to-day, and play.
<span id="L6084" class="ln">  6084</span>	Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L6085" class="ln">  6085</span>	
<span id="L6086" class="ln">  6086</span>	&#34;No. Who&#39;s Robin Hood?&#34;
<span id="L6087" class="ln">  6087</span>	
<span id="L6088" class="ln">  6088</span>	&#34;Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the
<span id="L6089" class="ln">  6089</span>	best. He was a robber.&#34;
<span id="L6090" class="ln">  6090</span>	
<span id="L6091" class="ln">  6091</span>	&#34;Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?&#34;
<span id="L6092" class="ln">  6092</span>	
<span id="L6093" class="ln">  6093</span>	&#34;Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like.
<span id="L6094" class="ln">  6094</span>	But he never bothered the poor. He loved &#39;em. He always divided up with
<span id="L6095" class="ln">  6095</span>	&#39;em perfectly square.&#34;
<span id="L6096" class="ln">  6096</span>	
<span id="L6097" class="ln">  6097</span>	&#34;Well, he must &#39;a&#39; been a brick.&#34;
<span id="L6098" class="ln">  6098</span>	
<span id="L6099" class="ln">  6099</span>	&#34;I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.
<span id="L6100" class="ln">  6100</span>	They ain&#39;t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in
<span id="L6101" class="ln">  6101</span>	England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow
<span id="L6102" class="ln">  6102</span>	and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.&#34;
<span id="L6103" class="ln">  6103</span>	
<span id="L6104" class="ln">  6104</span>	&#34;What&#39;s a YEW bow?&#34;
<span id="L6105" class="ln">  6105</span>	
<span id="L6106" class="ln">  6106</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that
<span id="L6107" class="ln">  6107</span>	dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse. But we&#39;ll
<span id="L6108" class="ln">  6108</span>	play Robin Hood--it&#39;s nobby fun. I&#39;ll learn you.&#34;
<span id="L6109" class="ln">  6109</span>	
<span id="L6110" class="ln">  6110</span>	&#34;I&#39;m agreed.&#34;
<span id="L6111" class="ln">  6111</span>	
<span id="L6112" class="ln">  6112</span>	So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a
<span id="L6113" class="ln">  6113</span>	yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
<span id="L6114" class="ln">  6114</span>	morrow&#39;s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink
<span id="L6115" class="ln">  6115</span>	into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of
<span id="L6116" class="ln">  6116</span>	the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff
<span id="L6117" class="ln">  6117</span>	Hill.
<span id="L6118" class="ln">  6118</span>	
<span id="L6119" class="ln">  6119</span>	On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.
<span id="L6120" class="ln">  6120</span>	They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in
<span id="L6121" class="ln">  6121</span>	their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there
<span id="L6122" class="ln">  6122</span>	were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting
<span id="L6123" class="ln">  6123</span>	down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and
<span id="L6124" class="ln">  6124</span>	turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this
<span id="L6125" class="ln">  6125</span>	time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
<span id="L6126" class="ln">  6126</span>	that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the
<span id="L6127" class="ln">  6127</span>	requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.
<span id="L6128" class="ln">  6128</span>	
<span id="L6129" class="ln">  6129</span>	When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
<span id="L6130" class="ln">  6130</span>	grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,
<span id="L6131" class="ln">  6131</span>	and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
<span id="L6132" class="ln">  6132</span>	place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they
<span id="L6133" class="ln">  6133</span>	crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weed-grown,
<span id="L6134" class="ln">  6134</span>	floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a
<span id="L6135" class="ln">  6135</span>	ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and
<span id="L6136" class="ln">  6136</span>	abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened
<span id="L6137" class="ln">  6137</span>	pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,
<span id="L6138" class="ln">  6138</span>	and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.
<span id="L6139" class="ln">  6139</span>	
<span id="L6140" class="ln">  6140</span>	In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
<span id="L6141" class="ln">  6141</span>	place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own
<span id="L6142" class="ln">  6142</span>	boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look up-stairs.
<span id="L6143" class="ln">  6143</span>	This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring
<span id="L6144" class="ln">  6144</span>	each other, and of course there could be but one result--they threw
<span id="L6145" class="ln">  6145</span>	their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same
<span id="L6146" class="ln">  6146</span>	signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised
<span id="L6147" class="ln">  6147</span>	mystery, but the promise was a fraud--there was nothing in it. Their
<span id="L6148" class="ln">  6148</span>	courage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down and
<span id="L6149" class="ln">  6149</span>	begin work when--
<span id="L6150" class="ln">  6150</span>	
<span id="L6151" class="ln">  6151</span>	&#34;Sh!&#34; said Tom.
<span id="L6152" class="ln">  6152</span>	
<span id="L6153" class="ln">  6153</span>	&#34;What is it?&#34; whispered Huck, blanching with fright.
<span id="L6154" class="ln">  6154</span>	
<span id="L6155" class="ln">  6155</span>	&#34;Sh!... There!... Hear it?&#34;
<span id="L6156" class="ln">  6156</span>	
<span id="L6157" class="ln">  6157</span>	&#34;Yes!... Oh, my! Let&#39;s run!&#34;
<span id="L6158" class="ln">  6158</span>	
<span id="L6159" class="ln">  6159</span>	&#34;Keep still! Don&#39;t you budge! They&#39;re coming right toward the door.&#34;
<span id="L6160" class="ln">  6160</span>	
<span id="L6161" class="ln">  6161</span>	The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
<span id="L6162" class="ln">  6162</span>	knot-holes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.
<span id="L6163" class="ln">  6163</span>	
<span id="L6164" class="ln">  6164</span>	&#34;They&#39;ve stopped.... No--coming.... Here they are. Don&#39;t whisper
<span id="L6165" class="ln">  6165</span>	another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!&#34;
<span id="L6166" class="ln">  6166</span>	
<span id="L6167" class="ln">  6167</span>	Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: &#34;There&#39;s the old deaf and
<span id="L6168" class="ln">  6168</span>	dumb Spaniard that&#39;s been about town once or twice lately--never saw
<span id="L6169" class="ln">  6169</span>	t&#39;other man before.&#34;
<span id="L6170" class="ln">  6170</span>	
<span id="L6171" class="ln">  6171</span>	&#34;T&#39;other&#34; was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant
<span id="L6172" class="ln">  6172</span>	in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white
<span id="L6173" class="ln">  6173</span>	whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore
<span id="L6174" class="ln">  6174</span>	green goggles. When they came in, &#34;t&#39;other&#34; was talking in a low voice;
<span id="L6175" class="ln">  6175</span>	they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the
<span id="L6176" class="ln">  6176</span>	wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less
<span id="L6177" class="ln">  6177</span>	guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:
<span id="L6178" class="ln">  6178</span>	
<span id="L6179" class="ln">  6179</span>	&#34;No,&#34; said he, &#34;I&#39;ve thought it all over, and I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s
<span id="L6180" class="ln">  6180</span>	dangerous.&#34;
<span id="L6181" class="ln">  6181</span>	
<span id="L6182" class="ln">  6182</span>	&#34;Dangerous!&#34; grunted the &#34;deaf and dumb&#34; Spaniard--to the vast
<span id="L6183" class="ln">  6183</span>	surprise of the boys. &#34;Milksop!&#34;
<span id="L6184" class="ln">  6184</span>	
<span id="L6185" class="ln">  6185</span>	This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe&#39;s! There was
<span id="L6186" class="ln">  6186</span>	silence for some time. Then Joe said:
<span id="L6187" class="ln">  6187</span>	
<span id="L6188" class="ln">  6188</span>	&#34;What&#39;s any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing&#39;s come
<span id="L6189" class="ln">  6189</span>	of it.&#34;
<span id="L6190" class="ln">  6190</span>	
<span id="L6191" class="ln">  6191</span>	&#34;That&#39;s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.
<span id="L6192" class="ln">  6192</span>	&#39;Twon&#39;t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn&#39;t succeed.&#34;
<span id="L6193" class="ln">  6193</span>	
<span id="L6194" class="ln">  6194</span>	&#34;Well, what&#39;s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody
<span id="L6195" class="ln">  6195</span>	would suspicion us that saw us.&#34;
<span id="L6196" class="ln">  6196</span>	
<span id="L6197" class="ln">  6197</span>	&#34;I know that. But there warn&#39;t any other place as handy after that
<span id="L6198" class="ln">  6198</span>	fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only
<span id="L6199" class="ln">  6199</span>	it warn&#39;t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys
<span id="L6200" class="ln">  6200</span>	playing over there on the hill right in full view.&#34;
<span id="L6201" class="ln">  6201</span>	
<span id="L6202" class="ln">  6202</span>	&#34;Those infernal boys&#34; quaked again under the inspiration of this
<span id="L6203" class="ln">  6203</span>	remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was
<span id="L6204" class="ln">  6204</span>	Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they
<span id="L6205" class="ln">  6205</span>	had waited a year.
<span id="L6206" class="ln">  6206</span>	
<span id="L6207" class="ln">  6207</span>	The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and
<span id="L6208" class="ln">  6208</span>	thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:
<span id="L6209" class="ln">  6209</span>	
<span id="L6210" class="ln">  6210</span>	&#34;Look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there
<span id="L6211" class="ln">  6211</span>	till you hear from me. I&#39;ll take the chances on dropping into this town
<span id="L6212" class="ln">  6212</span>	just once more, for a look. We&#39;ll do that &#39;dangerous&#39; job after I&#39;ve
<span id="L6213" class="ln">  6213</span>	spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for
<span id="L6214" class="ln">  6214</span>	Texas! We&#39;ll leg it together!&#34;
<span id="L6215" class="ln">  6215</span>	
<span id="L6216" class="ln">  6216</span>	This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun
<span id="L6217" class="ln">  6217</span>	Joe said:
<span id="L6218" class="ln">  6218</span>	
<span id="L6219" class="ln">  6219</span>	&#34;I&#39;m dead for sleep! It&#39;s your turn to watch.&#34;
<span id="L6220" class="ln">  6220</span>	
<span id="L6221" class="ln">  6221</span>	He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade
<span id="L6222" class="ln">  6222</span>	stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher
<span id="L6223" class="ln">  6223</span>	began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore
<span id="L6224" class="ln">  6224</span>	now.
<span id="L6225" class="ln">  6225</span>	
<span id="L6226" class="ln">  6226</span>	The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:
<span id="L6227" class="ln">  6227</span>	
<span id="L6228" class="ln">  6228</span>	&#34;Now&#39;s our chance--come!&#34;
<span id="L6229" class="ln">  6229</span>	
<span id="L6230" class="ln">  6230</span>	Huck said:
<span id="L6231" class="ln">  6231</span>	
<span id="L6232" class="ln">  6232</span>	&#34;I can&#39;t--I&#39;d die if they was to wake.&#34;
<span id="L6233" class="ln">  6233</span>	
<span id="L6234" class="ln">  6234</span>	Tom urged--Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and
<span id="L6235" class="ln">  6235</span>	started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
<span id="L6236" class="ln">  6236</span>	from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He
<span id="L6237" class="ln">  6237</span>	never made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging
<span id="L6238" class="ln">  6238</span>	moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity
<span id="L6239" class="ln">  6239</span>	growing gray; and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun
<span id="L6240" class="ln">  6240</span>	was setting.
<span id="L6241" class="ln">  6241</span>	
<span id="L6242" class="ln">  6242</span>	Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly
<span id="L6243" class="ln">  6243</span>	upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him
<span id="L6244" class="ln">  6244</span>	up with his foot and said:
<span id="L6245" class="ln">  6245</span>	
<span id="L6246" class="ln">  6246</span>	&#34;Here! YOU&#39;RE a watchman, ain&#39;t you! All right, though--nothing&#39;s
<span id="L6247" class="ln">  6247</span>	happened.&#34;
<span id="L6248" class="ln">  6248</span>	
<span id="L6249" class="ln">  6249</span>	&#34;My! have I been asleep?&#34;
<span id="L6250" class="ln">  6250</span>	
<span id="L6251" class="ln">  6251</span>	&#34;Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What&#39;ll we
<span id="L6252" class="ln">  6252</span>	do with what little swag we&#39;ve got left?&#34;
<span id="L6253" class="ln">  6253</span>	
<span id="L6254" class="ln">  6254</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t know--leave it here as we&#39;ve always done, I reckon. No use to
<span id="L6255" class="ln">  6255</span>	take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver&#39;s
<span id="L6256" class="ln">  6256</span>	something to carry.&#34;
<span id="L6257" class="ln">  6257</span>	
<span id="L6258" class="ln">  6258</span>	&#34;Well--all right--it won&#39;t matter to come here once more.&#34;
<span id="L6259" class="ln">  6259</span>	
<span id="L6260" class="ln">  6260</span>	&#34;No--but I&#39;d say come in the night as we used to do--it&#39;s better.&#34;
<span id="L6261" class="ln">  6261</span>	
<span id="L6262" class="ln">  6262</span>	&#34;Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right
<span id="L6263" class="ln">  6263</span>	chance at that job; accidents might happen; &#39;tain&#39;t in such a very good
<span id="L6264" class="ln">  6264</span>	place; we&#39;ll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.&#34;
<span id="L6265" class="ln">  6265</span>	
<span id="L6266" class="ln">  6266</span>	&#34;Good idea,&#34; said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
<span id="L6267" class="ln">  6267</span>	raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that
<span id="L6268" class="ln">  6268</span>	jingled pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for
<span id="L6269" class="ln">  6269</span>	himself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter,
<span id="L6270" class="ln">  6270</span>	who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.
<span id="L6271" class="ln">  6271</span>	
<span id="L6272" class="ln">  6272</span>	The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant.
<span id="L6273" class="ln">  6273</span>	With gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!--the splendor of
<span id="L6274" class="ln">  6274</span>	it was beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to
<span id="L6275" class="ln">  6275</span>	make half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the
<span id="L6276" class="ln">  6276</span>	happiest auspices--there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to
<span id="L6277" class="ln">  6277</span>	where to dig. They nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and
<span id="L6278" class="ln">  6278</span>	easily understood, for they simply meant--&#34;Oh, but ain&#39;t you glad NOW
<span id="L6279" class="ln">  6279</span>	we&#39;re here!&#34;
<span id="L6280" class="ln">  6280</span>	
<span id="L6281" class="ln">  6281</span>	Joe&#39;s knife struck upon something.
<span id="L6282" class="ln">  6282</span>	
<span id="L6283" class="ln">  6283</span>	&#34;Hello!&#34; said he.
<span id="L6284" class="ln">  6284</span>	
<span id="L6285" class="ln">  6285</span>	&#34;What is it?&#34; said his comrade.
<span id="L6286" class="ln">  6286</span>	
<span id="L6287" class="ln">  6287</span>	&#34;Half-rotten plank--no, it&#39;s a box, I believe. Here--bear a hand and
<span id="L6288" class="ln">  6288</span>	we&#39;ll see what it&#39;s here for. Never mind, I&#39;ve broke a hole.&#34;
<span id="L6289" class="ln">  6289</span>	
<span id="L6290" class="ln">  6290</span>	He reached his hand in and drew it out--
<span id="L6291" class="ln">  6291</span>	
<span id="L6292" class="ln">  6292</span>	&#34;Man, it&#39;s money!&#34;
<span id="L6293" class="ln">  6293</span>	
<span id="L6294" class="ln">  6294</span>	The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys
<span id="L6295" class="ln">  6295</span>	above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.
<span id="L6296" class="ln">  6296</span>	
<span id="L6297" class="ln">  6297</span>	Joe&#39;s comrade said:
<span id="L6298" class="ln">  6298</span>	
<span id="L6299" class="ln">  6299</span>	&#34;We&#39;ll make quick work of this. There&#39;s an old rusty pick over amongst
<span id="L6300" class="ln">  6300</span>	the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a
<span id="L6301" class="ln">  6301</span>	minute ago.&#34;
<span id="L6302" class="ln">  6302</span>	
<span id="L6303" class="ln">  6303</span>	He ran and brought the boys&#39; pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the pick,
<span id="L6304" class="ln">  6304</span>	looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to
<span id="L6305" class="ln">  6305</span>	himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was
<span id="L6306" class="ln">  6306</span>	not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
<span id="L6307" class="ln">  6307</span>	slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in
<span id="L6308" class="ln">  6308</span>	blissful silence.
<span id="L6309" class="ln">  6309</span>	
<span id="L6310" class="ln">  6310</span>	&#34;Pard, there&#39;s thousands of dollars here,&#34; said Injun Joe.
<span id="L6311" class="ln">  6311</span>	
<span id="L6312" class="ln">  6312</span>	&#34;&#39;Twas always said that Murrel&#39;s gang used to be around here one
<span id="L6313" class="ln">  6313</span>	summer,&#34; the stranger observed.
<span id="L6314" class="ln">  6314</span>	
<span id="L6315" class="ln">  6315</span>	&#34;I know it,&#34; said Injun Joe; &#34;and this looks like it, I should say.&#34;
<span id="L6316" class="ln">  6316</span>	
<span id="L6317" class="ln">  6317</span>	&#34;Now you won&#39;t need to do that job.&#34;
<span id="L6318" class="ln">  6318</span>	
<span id="L6319" class="ln">  6319</span>	The half-breed frowned. Said he:
<span id="L6320" class="ln">  6320</span>	
<span id="L6321" class="ln">  6321</span>	&#34;You don&#39;t know me. Least you don&#39;t know all about that thing. &#39;Tain&#39;t
<span id="L6322" class="ln">  6322</span>	robbery altogether--it&#39;s REVENGE!&#34; and a wicked light flamed in his
<span id="L6323" class="ln">  6323</span>	eyes. &#34;I&#39;ll need your help in it. When it&#39;s finished--then Texas. Go
<span id="L6324" class="ln">  6324</span>	home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.&#34;
<span id="L6325" class="ln">  6325</span>	
<span id="L6326" class="ln">  6326</span>	&#34;Well--if you say so; what&#39;ll we do with this--bury it again?&#34;
<span id="L6327" class="ln">  6327</span>	
<span id="L6328" class="ln">  6328</span>	&#34;Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] NO! by the great Sachem, no!
<span id="L6329" class="ln">  6329</span>	[Profound distress overhead.] I&#39;d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh
<span id="L6330" class="ln">  6330</span>	earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What
<span id="L6331" class="ln">  6331</span>	business has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth
<span id="L6332" class="ln">  6332</span>	on them? Who brought them here--and where are they gone? Have you heard
<span id="L6333" class="ln">  6333</span>	anybody?--seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and
<span id="L6334" class="ln">  6334</span>	see the ground disturbed? Not exactly--not exactly. We&#39;ll take it to my
<span id="L6335" class="ln">  6335</span>	den.&#34;
<span id="L6336" class="ln">  6336</span>	
<span id="L6337" class="ln">  6337</span>	&#34;Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number
<span id="L6338" class="ln">  6338</span>	One?&#34;
<span id="L6339" class="ln">  6339</span>	
<span id="L6340" class="ln">  6340</span>	&#34;No--Number Two--under the cross. The other place is bad--too common.&#34;
<span id="L6341" class="ln">  6341</span>	
<span id="L6342" class="ln">  6342</span>	&#34;All right. It&#39;s nearly dark enough to start.&#34;
<span id="L6343" class="ln">  6343</span>	
<span id="L6344" class="ln">  6344</span>	Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously
<span id="L6345" class="ln">  6345</span>	peeping out. Presently he said:
<span id="L6346" class="ln">  6346</span>	
<span id="L6347" class="ln">  6347</span>	&#34;Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be
<span id="L6348" class="ln">  6348</span>	up-stairs?&#34;
<span id="L6349" class="ln">  6349</span>	
<span id="L6350" class="ln">  6350</span>	The boys&#39; breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,
<span id="L6351" class="ln">  6351</span>	halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The
<span id="L6352" class="ln">  6352</span>	boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came
<span id="L6353" class="ln">  6353</span>	creaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke
<span id="L6354" class="ln">  6354</span>	the stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the
<span id="L6355" class="ln">  6355</span>	closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed
<span id="L6356" class="ln">  6356</span>	on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered
<span id="L6357" class="ln">  6357</span>	himself up cursing, and his comrade said:
<span id="L6358" class="ln">  6358</span>	
<span id="L6359" class="ln">  6359</span>	&#34;Now what&#39;s the use of all that? If it&#39;s anybody, and they&#39;re up
<span id="L6360" class="ln">  6360</span>	there, let them STAY there--who cares? If they want to jump down, now,
<span id="L6361" class="ln">  6361</span>	and get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes
<span id="L6362" class="ln">  6362</span>	--and then let them follow us if they want to. I&#39;m willing. In my
<span id="L6363" class="ln">  6363</span>	opinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and
<span id="L6364" class="ln">  6364</span>	took us for ghosts or devils or something. I&#39;ll bet they&#39;re running
<span id="L6365" class="ln">  6365</span>	yet.&#34;
<span id="L6366" class="ln">  6366</span>	
<span id="L6367" class="ln">  6367</span>	Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
<span id="L6368" class="ln">  6368</span>	was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.
<span id="L6369" class="ln">  6369</span>	Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening
<span id="L6370" class="ln">  6370</span>	twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.
<span id="L6371" class="ln">  6371</span>	
<span id="L6372" class="ln">  6372</span>	Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them
<span id="L6373" class="ln">  6373</span>	through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they.
<span id="L6374" class="ln">  6374</span>	They were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take
<span id="L6375" class="ln">  6375</span>	the townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too
<span id="L6376" class="ln">  6376</span>	much absorbed in hating themselves--hating the ill luck that made them
<span id="L6377" class="ln">  6377</span>	take the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would
<span id="L6378" class="ln">  6378</span>	have suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait
<span id="L6379" class="ln">  6379</span>	there till his &#34;revenge&#34; was satisfied, and then he would have had the
<span id="L6380" class="ln">  6380</span>	misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that
<span id="L6381" class="ln">  6381</span>	the tools were ever brought there!
<span id="L6382" class="ln">  6382</span>	
<span id="L6383" class="ln">  6383</span>	They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come
<span id="L6384" class="ln">  6384</span>	to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him
<span id="L6385" class="ln">  6385</span>	to &#34;Number Two,&#34; wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought
<span id="L6386" class="ln">  6386</span>	occurred to Tom.
<span id="L6387" class="ln">  6387</span>	
<span id="L6388" class="ln">  6388</span>	&#34;Revenge? What if he means US, Huck!&#34;
<span id="L6389" class="ln">  6389</span>	
<span id="L6390" class="ln">  6390</span>	&#34;Oh, don&#39;t!&#34; said Huck, nearly fainting.
<span id="L6391" class="ln">  6391</span>	
<span id="L6392" class="ln">  6392</span>	They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to
<span id="L6393" class="ln">  6393</span>	believe that he might possibly mean somebody else--at least that he
<span id="L6394" class="ln">  6394</span>	might at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.
<span id="L6395" class="ln">  6395</span>	
<span id="L6396" class="ln">  6396</span>	Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company
<span id="L6397" class="ln">  6397</span>	would be a palpable improvement, he thought.
<span id="L6398" class="ln">  6398</span>	
<span id="L6399" class="ln">  6399</span>	
<span id="L6400" class="ln">  6400</span>	
<span id="L6401" class="ln">  6401</span>	CHAPTER XXVII
<span id="L6402" class="ln">  6402</span>	
<span id="L6403" class="ln">  6403</span>	THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom&#39;s dreams that night.
<span id="L6404" class="ln">  6404</span>	Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it
<span id="L6405" class="ln">  6405</span>	wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
<span id="L6406" class="ln">  6406</span>	wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay
<span id="L6407" class="ln">  6407</span>	in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he
<span id="L6408" class="ln">  6408</span>	noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away--somewhat as if
<span id="L6409" class="ln">  6409</span>	they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it
<span id="L6410" class="ln">  6410</span>	occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There
<span id="L6411" class="ln">  6411</span>	was one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the
<span id="L6412" class="ln">  6412</span>	quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen
<span id="L6413" class="ln">  6413</span>	as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys
<span id="L6414" class="ln">  6414</span>	of his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references
<span id="L6415" class="ln">  6415</span>	to &#34;hundreds&#34; and &#34;thousands&#34; were mere fanciful forms of speech, and
<span id="L6416" class="ln">  6416</span>	that no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed
<span id="L6417" class="ln">  6417</span>	for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found
<span id="L6418" class="ln">  6418</span>	in actual money in any one&#39;s possession. If his notions of hidden
<span id="L6419" class="ln">  6419</span>	treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a
<span id="L6420" class="ln">  6420</span>	handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable
<span id="L6421" class="ln">  6421</span>	dollars.
<span id="L6422" class="ln">  6422</span>	
<span id="L6423" class="ln">  6423</span>	But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
<span id="L6424" class="ln">  6424</span>	under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found
<span id="L6425" class="ln">  6425</span>	himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
<span id="L6426" class="ln">  6426</span>	dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch
<span id="L6427" class="ln">  6427</span>	a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the
<span id="L6428" class="ln">  6428</span>	gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and
<span id="L6429" class="ln">  6429</span>	looking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the
<span id="L6430" class="ln">  6430</span>	subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to
<span id="L6431" class="ln">  6431</span>	have been only a dream.
<span id="L6432" class="ln">  6432</span>	
<span id="L6433" class="ln">  6433</span>	&#34;Hello, Huck!&#34;
<span id="L6434" class="ln">  6434</span>	
<span id="L6435" class="ln">  6435</span>	&#34;Hello, yourself.&#34;
<span id="L6436" class="ln">  6436</span>	
<span id="L6437" class="ln">  6437</span>	Silence, for a minute.
<span id="L6438" class="ln">  6438</span>	
<span id="L6439" class="ln">  6439</span>	&#34;Tom, if we&#39;d &#39;a&#39; left the blame tools at the dead tree, we&#39;d &#39;a&#39; got
<span id="L6440" class="ln">  6440</span>	the money. Oh, ain&#39;t it awful!&#34;
<span id="L6441" class="ln">  6441</span>	
<span id="L6442" class="ln">  6442</span>	&#34;&#39;Tain&#39;t a dream, then, &#39;tain&#39;t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.
<span id="L6443" class="ln">  6443</span>	Dog&#39;d if I don&#39;t, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L6444" class="ln">  6444</span>	
<span id="L6445" class="ln">  6445</span>	&#34;What ain&#39;t a dream?&#34;
<span id="L6446" class="ln">  6446</span>	
<span id="L6447" class="ln">  6447</span>	&#34;Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.&#34;
<span id="L6448" class="ln">  6448</span>	
<span id="L6449" class="ln">  6449</span>	&#34;Dream! If them stairs hadn&#39;t broke down you&#39;d &#39;a&#39; seen how much dream
<span id="L6450" class="ln">  6450</span>	it was! I&#39;ve had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish
<span id="L6451" class="ln">  6451</span>	devil going for me all through &#39;em--rot him!&#34;
<span id="L6452" class="ln">  6452</span>	
<span id="L6453" class="ln">  6453</span>	&#34;No, not rot him. FIND him! Track the money!&#34;
<span id="L6454" class="ln">  6454</span>	
<span id="L6455" class="ln">  6455</span>	&#34;Tom, we&#39;ll never find him. A feller don&#39;t have only one chance for
<span id="L6456" class="ln">  6456</span>	such a pile--and that one&#39;s lost. I&#39;d feel mighty shaky if I was to see
<span id="L6457" class="ln">  6457</span>	him, anyway.&#34;
<span id="L6458" class="ln">  6458</span>	
<span id="L6459" class="ln">  6459</span>	&#34;Well, so&#39;d I; but I&#39;d like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to
<span id="L6460" class="ln">  6460</span>	his Number Two.&#34;
<span id="L6461" class="ln">  6461</span>	
<span id="L6462" class="ln">  6462</span>	&#34;Number Two--yes, that&#39;s it. I been thinking &#39;bout that. But I can&#39;t
<span id="L6463" class="ln">  6463</span>	make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?&#34;
<span id="L6464" class="ln">  6464</span>	
<span id="L6465" class="ln">  6465</span>	&#34;I dono. It&#39;s too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it&#39;s the number of a house!&#34;
<span id="L6466" class="ln">  6466</span>	
<span id="L6467" class="ln">  6467</span>	&#34;Goody!... No, Tom, that ain&#39;t it. If it is, it ain&#39;t in this
<span id="L6468" class="ln">  6468</span>	one-horse town. They ain&#39;t no numbers here.&#34;
<span id="L6469" class="ln">  6469</span>	
<span id="L6470" class="ln">  6470</span>	&#34;Well, that&#39;s so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it&#39;s the number of a
<span id="L6471" class="ln">  6471</span>	room--in a tavern, you know!&#34;
<span id="L6472" class="ln">  6472</span>	
<span id="L6473" class="ln">  6473</span>	&#34;Oh, that&#39;s the trick! They ain&#39;t only two taverns. We can find out
<span id="L6474" class="ln">  6474</span>	quick.&#34;
<span id="L6475" class="ln">  6475</span>	
<span id="L6476" class="ln">  6476</span>	&#34;You stay here, Huck, till I come.&#34;
<span id="L6477" class="ln">  6477</span>	
<span id="L6478" class="ln">  6478</span>	Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck&#39;s company in public
<span id="L6479" class="ln">  6479</span>	places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.
<span id="L6480" class="ln">  6480</span>	2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.
<span id="L6481" class="ln">  6481</span>	In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The
<span id="L6482" class="ln">  6482</span>	tavern-keeper&#39;s young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he
<span id="L6483" class="ln">  6483</span>	never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night; he did
<span id="L6484" class="ln">  6484</span>	not know any particular reason for this state of things; had had some
<span id="L6485" class="ln">  6485</span>	little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the
<span id="L6486" class="ln">  6486</span>	mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was
<span id="L6487" class="ln">  6487</span>	&#34;ha&#39;nted&#34;; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.
<span id="L6488" class="ln">  6488</span>	
<span id="L6489" class="ln">  6489</span>	&#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve found out, Huck. I reckon that&#39;s the very No. 2
<span id="L6490" class="ln">  6490</span>	we&#39;re after.&#34;
<span id="L6491" class="ln">  6491</span>	
<span id="L6492" class="ln">  6492</span>	&#34;I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?&#34;
<span id="L6493" class="ln">  6493</span>	
<span id="L6494" class="ln">  6494</span>	&#34;Lemme think.&#34;
<span id="L6495" class="ln">  6495</span>	
<span id="L6496" class="ln">  6496</span>	Tom thought a long time. Then he said:
<span id="L6497" class="ln">  6497</span>	
<span id="L6498" class="ln">  6498</span>	&#34;I&#39;ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out
<span id="L6499" class="ln">  6499</span>	into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
<span id="L6500" class="ln">  6500</span>	of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the door-keys you can find,
<span id="L6501" class="ln">  6501</span>	and I&#39;ll nip all of auntie&#39;s, and the first dark night we&#39;ll go there
<span id="L6502" class="ln">  6502</span>	and try &#39;em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he
<span id="L6503" class="ln">  6503</span>	said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a
<span id="L6504" class="ln">  6504</span>	chance to get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if
<span id="L6505" class="ln">  6505</span>	he don&#39;t go to that No. 2, that ain&#39;t the place.&#34;
<span id="L6506" class="ln">  6506</span>	
<span id="L6507" class="ln">  6507</span>	&#34;Lordy, I don&#39;t want to foller him by myself!&#34;
<span id="L6508" class="ln">  6508</span>	
<span id="L6509" class="ln">  6509</span>	&#34;Why, it&#39;ll be night, sure. He mightn&#39;t ever see you--and if he did,
<span id="L6510" class="ln">  6510</span>	maybe he&#39;d never think anything.&#34;
<span id="L6511" class="ln">  6511</span>	
<span id="L6512" class="ln">  6512</span>	&#34;Well, if it&#39;s pretty dark I reckon I&#39;ll track him. I dono--I dono.
<span id="L6513" class="ln">  6513</span>	I&#39;ll try.&#34;
<span id="L6514" class="ln">  6514</span>	
<span id="L6515" class="ln">  6515</span>	&#34;You bet I&#39;ll follow him, if it&#39;s dark, Huck. Why, he might &#39;a&#39; found
<span id="L6516" class="ln">  6516</span>	out he couldn&#39;t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.&#34;
<span id="L6517" class="ln">  6517</span>	
<span id="L6518" class="ln">  6518</span>	&#34;It&#39;s so, Tom, it&#39;s so. I&#39;ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!&#34;
<span id="L6519" class="ln">  6519</span>	
<span id="L6520" class="ln">  6520</span>	&#34;Now you&#39;re TALKING! Don&#39;t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L6521" class="ln">  6521</span>	
<span id="L6522" class="ln">  6522</span>	
<span id="L6523" class="ln">  6523</span>	
<span id="L6524" class="ln">  6524</span>	CHAPTER XXVIII
<span id="L6525" class="ln">  6525</span>	
<span id="L6526" class="ln">  6526</span>	THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung
<span id="L6527" class="ln">  6527</span>	about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the
<span id="L6528" class="ln">  6528</span>	alley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the
<span id="L6529" class="ln">  6529</span>	alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the
<span id="L6530" class="ln">  6530</span>	tavern door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with
<span id="L6531" class="ln">  6531</span>	the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on,
<span id="L6532" class="ln">  6532</span>	Huck was to come and &#34;maow,&#34; whereupon he would slip out and try the
<span id="L6533" class="ln">  6533</span>	keys. But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and
<span id="L6534" class="ln">  6534</span>	retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.
<span id="L6535" class="ln">  6535</span>	
<span id="L6536" class="ln">  6536</span>	Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday
<span id="L6537" class="ln">  6537</span>	night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt&#39;s
<span id="L6538" class="ln">  6538</span>	old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the
<span id="L6539" class="ln">  6539</span>	lantern in Huck&#39;s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before
<span id="L6540" class="ln">  6540</span>	midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones
<span id="L6541" class="ln">  6541</span>	thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had
<span id="L6542" class="ln">  6542</span>	entered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of
<span id="L6543" class="ln">  6543</span>	darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by
<span id="L6544" class="ln">  6544</span>	occasional mutterings of distant thunder.
<span id="L6545" class="ln">  6545</span>	
<span id="L6546" class="ln">  6546</span>	Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
<span id="L6547" class="ln">  6547</span>	towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
<span id="L6548" class="ln">  6548</span>	Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a
<span id="L6549" class="ln">  6549</span>	season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck&#39;s spirits like a
<span id="L6550" class="ln">  6550</span>	mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it
<span id="L6551" class="ln">  6551</span>	would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive
<span id="L6552" class="ln">  6552</span>	yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have
<span id="L6553" class="ln">  6553</span>	fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
<span id="L6554" class="ln">  6554</span>	excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and
<span id="L6555" class="ln">  6555</span>	closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
<span id="L6556" class="ln">  6556</span>	momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
<span id="L6557" class="ln">  6557</span>	his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to
<span id="L6558" class="ln">  6558</span>	inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the
<span id="L6559" class="ln">  6559</span>	way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
<span id="L6560" class="ln">  6560</span>	tearing by him: &#34;Run!&#34; said he; &#34;run, for your life!&#34;
<span id="L6561" class="ln">  6561</span>	
<span id="L6562" class="ln">  6562</span>	He needn&#39;t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty
<span id="L6563" class="ln">  6563</span>	or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys
<span id="L6564" class="ln">  6564</span>	never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house
<span id="L6565" class="ln">  6565</span>	at the lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter
<span id="L6566" class="ln">  6566</span>	the storm burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath
<span id="L6567" class="ln">  6567</span>	he said:
<span id="L6568" class="ln">  6568</span>	
<span id="L6569" class="ln">  6569</span>	&#34;Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
<span id="L6570" class="ln">  6570</span>	but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn&#39;t hardly
<span id="L6571" class="ln">  6571</span>	get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn&#39;t turn in the lock, either.
<span id="L6572" class="ln">  6572</span>	Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and
<span id="L6573" class="ln">  6573</span>	open comes the door! It warn&#39;t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the
<span id="L6574" class="ln">  6574</span>	towel, and, GREAT CAESAR&#39;S GHOST!&#34;
<span id="L6575" class="ln">  6575</span>	
<span id="L6576" class="ln">  6576</span>	&#34;What!--what&#39;d you see, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L6577" class="ln">  6577</span>	
<span id="L6578" class="ln">  6578</span>	&#34;Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe&#39;s hand!&#34;
<span id="L6579" class="ln">  6579</span>	
<span id="L6580" class="ln">  6580</span>	&#34;No!&#34;
<span id="L6581" class="ln">  6581</span>	
<span id="L6582" class="ln">  6582</span>	&#34;Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old
<span id="L6583" class="ln">  6583</span>	patch on his eye and his arms spread out.&#34;
<span id="L6584" class="ln">  6584</span>	
<span id="L6585" class="ln">  6585</span>	&#34;Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?&#34;
<span id="L6586" class="ln">  6586</span>	
<span id="L6587" class="ln">  6587</span>	&#34;No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
<span id="L6588" class="ln">  6588</span>	started!&#34;
<span id="L6589" class="ln">  6589</span>	
<span id="L6590" class="ln">  6590</span>	&#34;I&#39;d never &#39;a&#39; thought of the towel, I bet!&#34;
<span id="L6591" class="ln">  6591</span>	
<span id="L6592" class="ln">  6592</span>	&#34;Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.&#34;
<span id="L6593" class="ln">  6593</span>	
<span id="L6594" class="ln">  6594</span>	&#34;Say, Tom, did you see that box?&#34;
<span id="L6595" class="ln">  6595</span>	
<span id="L6596" class="ln">  6596</span>	&#34;Huck, I didn&#39;t wait to look around. I didn&#39;t see the box, I didn&#39;t
<span id="L6597" class="ln">  6597</span>	see the cross. I didn&#39;t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the
<span id="L6598" class="ln">  6598</span>	floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the
<span id="L6599" class="ln">  6599</span>	room. Don&#39;t you see, now, what&#39;s the matter with that ha&#39;nted room?&#34;
<span id="L6600" class="ln">  6600</span>	
<span id="L6601" class="ln">  6601</span>	&#34;How?&#34;
<span id="L6602" class="ln">  6602</span>	
<span id="L6603" class="ln">  6603</span>	&#34;Why, it&#39;s ha&#39;nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns have
<span id="L6604" class="ln">  6604</span>	got a ha&#39;nted room, hey, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L6605" class="ln">  6605</span>	
<span id="L6606" class="ln">  6606</span>	&#34;Well, I reckon maybe that&#39;s so. Who&#39;d &#39;a&#39; thought such a thing? But
<span id="L6607" class="ln">  6607</span>	say, Tom, now&#39;s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe&#39;s
<span id="L6608" class="ln">  6608</span>	drunk.&#34;
<span id="L6609" class="ln">  6609</span>	
<span id="L6610" class="ln">  6610</span>	&#34;It is, that! You try it!&#34;
<span id="L6611" class="ln">  6611</span>	
<span id="L6612" class="ln">  6612</span>	Huck shuddered.
<span id="L6613" class="ln">  6613</span>	
<span id="L6614" class="ln">  6614</span>	&#34;Well, no--I reckon not.&#34;
<span id="L6615" class="ln">  6615</span>	
<span id="L6616" class="ln">  6616</span>	&#34;And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain&#39;t
<span id="L6617" class="ln">  6617</span>	enough. If there&#39;d been three, he&#39;d be drunk enough and I&#39;d do it.&#34;
<span id="L6618" class="ln">  6618</span>	
<span id="L6619" class="ln">  6619</span>	There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:
<span id="L6620" class="ln">  6620</span>	
<span id="L6621" class="ln">  6621</span>	&#34;Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
<span id="L6622" class="ln">  6622</span>	Joe&#39;s not in there. It&#39;s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we&#39;ll
<span id="L6623" class="ln">  6623</span>	be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we&#39;ll
<span id="L6624" class="ln">  6624</span>	snatch that box quicker&#39;n lightning.&#34;
<span id="L6625" class="ln">  6625</span>	
<span id="L6626" class="ln">  6626</span>	&#34;Well, I&#39;m agreed. I&#39;ll watch the whole night long, and I&#39;ll do it
<span id="L6627" class="ln">  6627</span>	every night, too, if you&#39;ll do the other part of the job.&#34;
<span id="L6628" class="ln">  6628</span>	
<span id="L6629" class="ln">  6629</span>	&#34;All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
<span id="L6630" class="ln">  6630</span>	block and maow--and if I&#39;m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
<span id="L6631" class="ln">  6631</span>	and that&#39;ll fetch me.&#34;
<span id="L6632" class="ln">  6632</span>	
<span id="L6633" class="ln">  6633</span>	&#34;Agreed, and good as wheat!&#34;
<span id="L6634" class="ln">  6634</span>	
<span id="L6635" class="ln">  6635</span>	&#34;Now, Huck, the storm&#39;s over, and I&#39;ll go home. It&#39;ll begin to be
<span id="L6636" class="ln">  6636</span>	daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will
<span id="L6637" class="ln">  6637</span>	you?&#34;
<span id="L6638" class="ln">  6638</span>	
<span id="L6639" class="ln">  6639</span>	&#34;I said I would, Tom, and I will. I&#39;ll ha&#39;nt that tavern every night
<span id="L6640" class="ln">  6640</span>	for a year! I&#39;ll sleep all day and I&#39;ll stand watch all night.&#34;
<span id="L6641" class="ln">  6641</span>	
<span id="L6642" class="ln">  6642</span>	&#34;That&#39;s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?&#34;
<span id="L6643" class="ln">  6643</span>	
<span id="L6644" class="ln">  6644</span>	&#34;In Ben Rogers&#39; hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap&#39;s nigger man,
<span id="L6645" class="ln">  6645</span>	Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and
<span id="L6646" class="ln">  6646</span>	any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can
<span id="L6647" class="ln">  6647</span>	spare it. That&#39;s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don&#39;t
<span id="L6648" class="ln">  6648</span>	ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I&#39;ve set right down and eat
<span id="L6649" class="ln">  6649</span>	WITH him. But you needn&#39;t tell that. A body&#39;s got to do things when
<span id="L6650" class="ln">  6650</span>	he&#39;s awful hungry he wouldn&#39;t want to do as a steady thing.&#34;
<span id="L6651" class="ln">  6651</span>	
<span id="L6652" class="ln">  6652</span>	&#34;Well, if I don&#39;t want you in the daytime, I&#39;ll let you sleep. I won&#39;t
<span id="L6653" class="ln">  6653</span>	come bothering around. Any time you see something&#39;s up, in the night,
<span id="L6654" class="ln">  6654</span>	just skip right around and maow.&#34;
<span id="L6655" class="ln">  6655</span>	
<span id="L6656" class="ln">  6656</span>	
<span id="L6657" class="ln">  6657</span>	
<span id="L6658" class="ln">  6658</span>	CHAPTER XXIX
<span id="L6659" class="ln">  6659</span>	
<span id="L6660" class="ln">  6660</span>	THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news
<span id="L6661" class="ln">  6661</span>	--Judge Thatcher&#39;s family had come back to town the night before. Both
<span id="L6662" class="ln">  6662</span>	Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment,
<span id="L6663" class="ln">  6663</span>	and Becky took the chief place in the boy&#39;s interest. He saw her and
<span id="L6664" class="ln">  6664</span>	they had an exhausting good time playing &#34;hi-spy&#34; and &#34;gully-keeper&#34;
<span id="L6665" class="ln">  6665</span>	with a crowd of their school-mates. The day was completed and crowned
<span id="L6666" class="ln">  6666</span>	in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint
<span id="L6667" class="ln">  6667</span>	the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
<span id="L6668" class="ln">  6668</span>	consented. The child&#39;s delight was boundless; and Tom&#39;s not more
<span id="L6669" class="ln">  6669</span>	moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway
<span id="L6670" class="ln">  6670</span>	the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
<span id="L6671" class="ln">  6671</span>	and pleasurable anticipation. Tom&#39;s excitement enabled him to keep
<span id="L6672" class="ln">  6672</span>	awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck&#39;s
<span id="L6673" class="ln">  6673</span>	&#34;maow,&#34; and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers
<span id="L6674" class="ln">  6674</span>	with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.
<span id="L6675" class="ln">  6675</span>	
<span id="L6676" class="ln">  6676</span>	Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o&#39;clock a giddy and
<span id="L6677" class="ln">  6677</span>	rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher&#39;s, and everything
<span id="L6678" class="ln">  6678</span>	was ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar
<span id="L6679" class="ln">  6679</span>	the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe
<span id="L6680" class="ln">  6680</span>	enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few
<span id="L6681" class="ln">  6681</span>	young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferryboat
<span id="L6682" class="ln">  6682</span>	was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the
<span id="L6683" class="ln">  6683</span>	main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss
<span id="L6684" class="ln">  6684</span>	the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.
<span id="L6685" class="ln">  6685</span>	Thatcher said to Becky, was:
<span id="L6686" class="ln">  6686</span>	
<span id="L6687" class="ln">  6687</span>	&#34;You&#39;ll not get back till late. Perhaps you&#39;d better stay all night
<span id="L6688" class="ln">  6688</span>	with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.&#34;
<span id="L6689" class="ln">  6689</span>	
<span id="L6690" class="ln">  6690</span>	&#34;Then I&#39;ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.&#34;
<span id="L6691" class="ln">  6691</span>	
<span id="L6692" class="ln">  6692</span>	&#34;Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don&#39;t be any trouble.&#34;
<span id="L6693" class="ln">  6693</span>	
<span id="L6694" class="ln">  6694</span>	Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:
<span id="L6695" class="ln">  6695</span>	
<span id="L6696" class="ln">  6696</span>	&#34;Say--I&#39;ll tell you what we&#39;ll do. &#39;Stead of going to Joe Harper&#39;s
<span id="L6697" class="ln">  6697</span>	we&#39;ll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas&#39;. She&#39;ll
<span id="L6698" class="ln">  6698</span>	have ice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she&#39;ll
<span id="L6699" class="ln">  6699</span>	be awful glad to have us.&#34;
<span id="L6700" class="ln">  6700</span>	
<span id="L6701" class="ln">  6701</span>	&#34;Oh, that will be fun!&#34;
<span id="L6702" class="ln">  6702</span>	
<span id="L6703" class="ln">  6703</span>	Then Becky reflected a moment and said:
<span id="L6704" class="ln">  6704</span>	
<span id="L6705" class="ln">  6705</span>	&#34;But what will mamma say?&#34;
<span id="L6706" class="ln">  6706</span>	
<span id="L6707" class="ln">  6707</span>	&#34;How&#39;ll she ever know?&#34;
<span id="L6708" class="ln">  6708</span>	
<span id="L6709" class="ln">  6709</span>	The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:
<span id="L6710" class="ln">  6710</span>	
<span id="L6711" class="ln">  6711</span>	&#34;I reckon it&#39;s wrong--but--&#34;
<span id="L6712" class="ln">  6712</span>	
<span id="L6713" class="ln">  6713</span>	&#34;But shucks! Your mother won&#39;t know, and so what&#39;s the harm? All she
<span id="L6714" class="ln">  6714</span>	wants is that you&#39;ll be safe; and I bet you she&#39;d &#39;a&#39; said go there if
<span id="L6715" class="ln">  6715</span>	she&#39;d &#39;a&#39; thought of it. I know she would!&#34;
<span id="L6716" class="ln">  6716</span>	
<span id="L6717" class="ln">  6717</span>	The Widow Douglas&#39; splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and
<span id="L6718" class="ln">  6718</span>	Tom&#39;s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say
<span id="L6719" class="ln">  6719</span>	nothing anybody about the night&#39;s programme. Presently it occurred to
<span id="L6720" class="ln">  6720</span>	Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The
<span id="L6721" class="ln">  6721</span>	thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he
<span id="L6722" class="ln">  6722</span>	could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas&#39;. And why should he
<span id="L6723" class="ln">  6723</span>	give it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so
<span id="L6724" class="ln">  6724</span>	why should it be any more likely to come to-night? The sure fun of the
<span id="L6725" class="ln">  6725</span>	evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
<span id="L6726" class="ln">  6726</span>	to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
<span id="L6727" class="ln">  6727</span>	the box of money another time that day.
<span id="L6728" class="ln">  6728</span>	
<span id="L6729" class="ln">  6729</span>	Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
<span id="L6730" class="ln">  6730</span>	hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
<span id="L6731" class="ln">  6731</span>	distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
<span id="L6732" class="ln">  6732</span>	laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
<span id="L6733" class="ln">  6733</span>	through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
<span id="L6734" class="ln">  6734</span>	with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
<span id="L6735" class="ln">  6735</span>	began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat
<span id="L6736" class="ln">  6736</span>	in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:
<span id="L6737" class="ln">  6737</span>	
<span id="L6738" class="ln">  6738</span>	&#34;Who&#39;s ready for the cave?&#34;
<span id="L6739" class="ln">  6739</span>	
<span id="L6740" class="ln">  6740</span>	Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
<span id="L6741" class="ln">  6741</span>	was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the
<span id="L6742" class="ln">  6742</span>	hillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door
<span id="L6743" class="ln">  6743</span>	stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house, and
<span id="L6744" class="ln">  6744</span>	walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.
<span id="L6745" class="ln">  6745</span>	It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look
<span id="L6746" class="ln">  6746</span>	out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of
<span id="L6747" class="ln">  6747</span>	the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment
<span id="L6748" class="ln">  6748</span>	a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
<span id="L6749" class="ln">  6749</span>	struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon
<span id="L6750" class="ln">  6750</span>	knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter
<span id="L6751" class="ln">  6751</span>	and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession
<span id="L6752" class="ln">  6752</span>	went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering
<span id="L6753" class="ln">  6753</span>	rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their
<span id="L6754" class="ln">  6754</span>	point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more
<span id="L6755" class="ln">  6755</span>	than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still
<span id="L6756" class="ln">  6756</span>	narrower crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal&#39;s cave
<span id="L6757" class="ln">  6757</span>	was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and
<span id="L6758" class="ln">  6758</span>	out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and
<span id="L6759" class="ln">  6759</span>	nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and
<span id="L6760" class="ln">  6760</span>	never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down,
<span id="L6761" class="ln">  6761</span>	and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth
<span id="L6762" class="ln">  6762</span>	under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man &#34;knew&#34; the cave.
<span id="L6763" class="ln">  6763</span>	That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of
<span id="L6764" class="ln">  6764</span>	it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.
<span id="L6765" class="ln">  6765</span>	Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.
<span id="L6766" class="ln">  6766</span>	
<span id="L6767" class="ln">  6767</span>	The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a
<span id="L6768" class="ln">  6768</span>	mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
<span id="L6769" class="ln">  6769</span>	avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by
<span id="L6770" class="ln">  6770</span>	surprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able
<span id="L6771" class="ln">  6771</span>	to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond
<span id="L6772" class="ln">  6772</span>	the &#34;known&#34; ground.
<span id="L6773" class="ln">  6773</span>	
<span id="L6774" class="ln">  6774</span>	By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
<span id="L6775" class="ln">  6775</span>	of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
<span id="L6776" class="ln">  6776</span>	drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
<span id="L6777" class="ln">  6777</span>	the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no
<span id="L6778" class="ln">  6778</span>	note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had
<span id="L6779" class="ln">  6779</span>	been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day&#39;s
<span id="L6780" class="ln">  6780</span>	adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat
<span id="L6781" class="ln">  6781</span>	with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
<span id="L6782" class="ln">  6782</span>	the wasted time but the captain of the craft.
<span id="L6783" class="ln">  6783</span>	
<span id="L6784" class="ln">  6784</span>	Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat&#39;s lights went
<span id="L6785" class="ln">  6785</span>	glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young
<span id="L6786" class="ln">  6786</span>	people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
<span id="L6787" class="ln">  6787</span>	tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop
<span id="L6788" class="ln">  6788</span>	at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
<span id="L6789" class="ln">  6789</span>	attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten
<span id="L6790" class="ln">  6790</span>	o&#39;clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began
<span id="L6791" class="ln">  6791</span>	to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village
<span id="L6792" class="ln">  6792</span>	betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
<span id="L6793" class="ln">  6793</span>	silence and the ghosts. Eleven o&#39;clock came, and the tavern lights were
<span id="L6794" class="ln">  6794</span>	put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long
<span id="L6795" class="ln">  6795</span>	time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?
<span id="L6796" class="ln">  6796</span>	Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?
<span id="L6797" class="ln">  6797</span>	
<span id="L6798" class="ln">  6798</span>	A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The
<span id="L6799" class="ln">  6799</span>	alley door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store.
<span id="L6800" class="ln">  6800</span>	The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have
<span id="L6801" class="ln">  6801</span>	something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to
<span id="L6802" class="ln">  6802</span>	remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men
<span id="L6803" class="ln">  6803</span>	would get away with the box and never be found again. No, he would
<span id="L6804" class="ln">  6804</span>	stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for
<span id="L6805" class="ln">  6805</span>	security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out
<span id="L6806" class="ln">  6806</span>	and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing
<span id="L6807" class="ln">  6807</span>	them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.
<span id="L6808" class="ln">  6808</span>	
<span id="L6809" class="ln">  6809</span>	They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left
<span id="L6810" class="ln">  6810</span>	up a cross-street. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to
<span id="L6811" class="ln">  6811</span>	the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the
<span id="L6812" class="ln">  6812</span>	old Welshman&#39;s house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and
<span id="L6813" class="ln">  6813</span>	still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old
<span id="L6814" class="ln">  6814</span>	quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the
<span id="L6815" class="ln">  6815</span>	summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach
<span id="L6816" class="ln">  6816</span>	bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and
<span id="L6817" class="ln">  6817</span>	shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him.
<span id="L6818" class="ln">  6818</span>	He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was
<span id="L6819" class="ln">  6819</span>	gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened;
<span id="L6820" class="ln">  6820</span>	no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own
<span id="L6821" class="ln">  6821</span>	heart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill--ominous sound! But no
<span id="L6822" class="ln">  6822</span>	footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with
<span id="L6823" class="ln">  6823</span>	winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him!
<span id="L6824" class="ln">  6824</span>	Huck&#39;s heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then
<span id="L6825" class="ln">  6825</span>	he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at
<span id="L6826" class="ln">  6826</span>	once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He
<span id="L6827" class="ln">  6827</span>	knew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile
<span id="L6828" class="ln">  6828</span>	leading into Widow Douglas&#39; grounds. Very well, he thought, let them
<span id="L6829" class="ln">  6829</span>	bury it there; it won&#39;t be hard to find.
<span id="L6830" class="ln">  6830</span>	
<span id="L6831" class="ln">  6831</span>	Now there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe&#39;s:
<span id="L6832" class="ln">  6832</span>	
<span id="L6833" class="ln">  6833</span>	&#34;Damn her, maybe she&#39;s got company--there&#39;s lights, late as it is.&#34;
<span id="L6834" class="ln">  6834</span>	
<span id="L6835" class="ln">  6835</span>	&#34;I can&#39;t see any.&#34;
<span id="L6836" class="ln">  6836</span>	
<span id="L6837" class="ln">  6837</span>	This was that stranger&#39;s voice--the stranger of the haunted house. A
<span id="L6838" class="ln">  6838</span>	deadly chill went to Huck&#39;s heart--this, then, was the &#34;revenge&#34; job!
<span id="L6839" class="ln">  6839</span>	His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had
<span id="L6840" class="ln">  6840</span>	been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to
<span id="L6841" class="ln">  6841</span>	murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he
<span id="L6842" class="ln">  6842</span>	didn&#39;t dare--they might come and catch him. He thought all this and
<span id="L6843" class="ln">  6843</span>	more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger&#39;s remark and Injun
<span id="L6844" class="ln">  6844</span>	Joe&#39;s next--which was--
<span id="L6845" class="ln">  6845</span>	
<span id="L6846" class="ln">  6846</span>	&#34;Because the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don&#39;t
<span id="L6847" class="ln">  6847</span>	you?&#34;
<span id="L6848" class="ln">  6848</span>	
<span id="L6849" class="ln">  6849</span>	&#34;Yes. Well, there IS company there, I reckon. Better give it up.&#34;
<span id="L6850" class="ln">  6850</span>	
<span id="L6851" class="ln">  6851</span>	&#34;Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
<span id="L6852" class="ln">  6852</span>	maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I&#39;ve told you
<span id="L6853" class="ln">  6853</span>	before, I don&#39;t care for her swag--you may have it. But her husband was
<span id="L6854" class="ln">  6854</span>	rough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the
<span id="L6855" class="ln">  6855</span>	justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain&#39;t all.
<span id="L6856" class="ln">  6856</span>	It ain&#39;t a millionth part of it! He had me HORSEWHIPPED!--horsewhipped
<span id="L6857" class="ln">  6857</span>	in front of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on!
<span id="L6858" class="ln">  6858</span>	HORSEWHIPPED!--do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But
<span id="L6859" class="ln">  6859</span>	I&#39;ll take it out of HER.&#34;
<span id="L6860" class="ln">  6860</span>	
<span id="L6861" class="ln">  6861</span>	&#34;Oh, don&#39;t kill her! Don&#39;t do that!&#34;
<span id="L6862" class="ln">  6862</span>	
<span id="L6863" class="ln">  6863</span>	&#34;Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill HIM if he was
<span id="L6864" class="ln">  6864</span>	here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don&#39;t
<span id="L6865" class="ln">  6865</span>	kill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch
<span id="L6866" class="ln">  6866</span>	her ears like a sow!&#34;
<span id="L6867" class="ln">  6867</span>	
<span id="L6868" class="ln">  6868</span>	&#34;By God, that&#39;s--&#34;
<span id="L6869" class="ln">  6869</span>	
<span id="L6870" class="ln">  6870</span>	&#34;Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I&#39;ll tie
<span id="L6871" class="ln">  6871</span>	her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I&#39;ll not cry,
<span id="L6872" class="ln">  6872</span>	if she does. My friend, you&#39;ll help me in this thing--for MY sake
<span id="L6873" class="ln">  6873</span>	--that&#39;s why you&#39;re here--I mightn&#39;t be able alone. If you flinch, I&#39;ll
<span id="L6874" class="ln">  6874</span>	kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I&#39;ll kill
<span id="L6875" class="ln">  6875</span>	her--and then I reckon nobody&#39;ll ever know much about who done this
<span id="L6876" class="ln">  6876</span>	business.&#34;
<span id="L6877" class="ln">  6877</span>	
<span id="L6878" class="ln">  6878</span>	&#34;Well, if it&#39;s got to be done, let&#39;s get at it. The quicker the
<span id="L6879" class="ln">  6879</span>	better--I&#39;m all in a shiver.&#34;
<span id="L6880" class="ln">  6880</span>	
<span id="L6881" class="ln">  6881</span>	&#34;Do it NOW? And company there? Look here--I&#39;ll get suspicious of you,
<span id="L6882" class="ln">  6882</span>	first thing you know. No--we&#39;ll wait till the lights are out--there&#39;s
<span id="L6883" class="ln">  6883</span>	no hurry.&#34;
<span id="L6884" class="ln">  6884</span>	
<span id="L6885" class="ln">  6885</span>	Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful
<span id="L6886" class="ln">  6886</span>	than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
<span id="L6887" class="ln">  6887</span>	gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
<span id="L6888" class="ln">  6888</span>	one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one
<span id="L6889" class="ln">  6889</span>	side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same
<span id="L6890" class="ln">  6890</span>	elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig
<span id="L6891" class="ln">  6891</span>	snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was
<span id="L6892" class="ln">  6892</span>	no sound--the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now
<span id="L6893" class="ln">  6893</span>	he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned
<span id="L6894" class="ln">  6894</span>	himself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but
<span id="L6895" class="ln">  6895</span>	cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so
<span id="L6896" class="ln">  6896</span>	he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he
<span id="L6897" class="ln">  6897</span>	reached the Welshman&#39;s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads
<span id="L6898" class="ln">  6898</span>	of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.
<span id="L6899" class="ln">  6899</span>	
<span id="L6900" class="ln">  6900</span>	&#34;What&#39;s the row there? Who&#39;s banging? What do you want?&#34;
<span id="L6901" class="ln">  6901</span>	
<span id="L6902" class="ln">  6902</span>	&#34;Let me in--quick! I&#39;ll tell everything.&#34;
<span id="L6903" class="ln">  6903</span>	
<span id="L6904" class="ln">  6904</span>	&#34;Why, who are you?&#34;
<span id="L6905" class="ln">  6905</span>	
<span id="L6906" class="ln">  6906</span>	&#34;Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!&#34;
<span id="L6907" class="ln">  6907</span>	
<span id="L6908" class="ln">  6908</span>	&#34;Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain&#39;t a name to open many doors, I
<span id="L6909" class="ln">  6909</span>	judge! But let him in, lads, and let&#39;s see what&#39;s the trouble.&#34;
<span id="L6910" class="ln">  6910</span>	
<span id="L6911" class="ln">  6911</span>	&#34;Please don&#39;t ever tell I told you,&#34; were Huck&#39;s first words when he
<span id="L6912" class="ln">  6912</span>	got in. &#34;Please don&#39;t--I&#39;d be killed, sure--but the widow&#39;s been good
<span id="L6913" class="ln">  6913</span>	friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell--I WILL tell if you&#39;ll
<span id="L6914" class="ln">  6914</span>	promise you won&#39;t ever say it was me.&#34;
<span id="L6915" class="ln">  6915</span>	
<span id="L6916" class="ln">  6916</span>	&#34;By George, he HAS got something to tell, or he wouldn&#39;t act so!&#34;
<span id="L6917" class="ln">  6917</span>	exclaimed the old man; &#34;out with it and nobody here&#39;ll ever tell, lad.&#34;
<span id="L6918" class="ln">  6918</span>	
<span id="L6919" class="ln">  6919</span>	Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the
<span id="L6920" class="ln">  6920</span>	hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in
<span id="L6921" class="ln">  6921</span>	their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great
<span id="L6922" class="ln">  6922</span>	bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence,
<span id="L6923" class="ln">  6923</span>	and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.
<span id="L6924" class="ln">  6924</span>	
<span id="L6925" class="ln">  6925</span>	Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill
<span id="L6926" class="ln">  6926</span>	as fast as his legs could carry him.
<span id="L6927" class="ln">  6927</span>	
<span id="L6928" class="ln">  6928</span>	
<span id="L6929" class="ln">  6929</span>	
<span id="L6930" class="ln">  6930</span>	CHAPTER XXX
<span id="L6931" class="ln">  6931</span>	
<span id="L6932" class="ln">  6932</span>	AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck
<span id="L6933" class="ln">  6933</span>	came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman&#39;s door.
<span id="L6934" class="ln">  6934</span>	The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a
<span id="L6935" class="ln">  6935</span>	hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call
<span id="L6936" class="ln">  6936</span>	came from a window:
<span id="L6937" class="ln">  6937</span>	
<span id="L6938" class="ln">  6938</span>	&#34;Who&#39;s there!&#34;
<span id="L6939" class="ln">  6939</span>	
<span id="L6940" class="ln">  6940</span>	Huck&#39;s scared voice answered in a low tone:
<span id="L6941" class="ln">  6941</span>	
<span id="L6942" class="ln">  6942</span>	&#34;Please let me in! It&#39;s only Huck Finn!&#34;
<span id="L6943" class="ln">  6943</span>	
<span id="L6944" class="ln">  6944</span>	&#34;It&#39;s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!&#34;
<span id="L6945" class="ln">  6945</span>	
<span id="L6946" class="ln">  6946</span>	These were strange words to the vagabond boy&#39;s ears, and the
<span id="L6947" class="ln">  6947</span>	pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing
<span id="L6948" class="ln">  6948</span>	word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly
<span id="L6949" class="ln">  6949</span>	unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his
<span id="L6950" class="ln">  6950</span>	brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.
<span id="L6951" class="ln">  6951</span>	
<span id="L6952" class="ln">  6952</span>	&#34;Now, my boy, I hope you&#39;re good and hungry, because breakfast will be
<span id="L6953" class="ln">  6953</span>	ready as soon as the sun&#39;s up, and we&#39;ll have a piping hot one, too
<span id="L6954" class="ln">  6954</span>	--make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you&#39;d turn up and
<span id="L6955" class="ln">  6955</span>	stop here last night.&#34;
<span id="L6956" class="ln">  6956</span>	
<span id="L6957" class="ln">  6957</span>	&#34;I was awful scared,&#34; said Huck, &#34;and I run. I took out when the
<span id="L6958" class="ln">  6958</span>	pistols went off, and I didn&#39;t stop for three mile. I&#39;ve come now becuz
<span id="L6959" class="ln">  6959</span>	I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I
<span id="L6960" class="ln">  6960</span>	didn&#39;t want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.&#34;
<span id="L6961" class="ln">  6961</span>	
<span id="L6962" class="ln">  6962</span>	&#34;Well, poor chap, you do look as if you&#39;d had a hard night of it--but
<span id="L6963" class="ln">  6963</span>	there&#39;s a bed here for you when you&#39;ve had your breakfast. No, they
<span id="L6964" class="ln">  6964</span>	ain&#39;t dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right
<span id="L6965" class="ln">  6965</span>	where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along
<span id="L6966" class="ln">  6966</span>	on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar
<span id="L6967" class="ln">  6967</span>	that sumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It
<span id="L6968" class="ln">  6968</span>	was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use
<span id="L6969" class="ln">  6969</span>	--&#39;twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol
<span id="L6970" class="ln">  6970</span>	raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get
<span id="L6971" class="ln">  6971</span>	out of the path, I sung out, &#39;Fire boys!&#39; and blazed away at the place
<span id="L6972" class="ln">  6972</span>	where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy,
<span id="L6973" class="ln">  6973</span>	those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we
<span id="L6974" class="ln">  6974</span>	never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their
<span id="L6975" class="ln">  6975</span>	bullets whizzed by and didn&#39;t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the
<span id="L6976" class="ln">  6976</span>	sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the
<span id="L6977" class="ln">  6977</span>	constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river
<span id="L6978" class="ln">  6978</span>	bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to
<span id="L6979" class="ln">  6979</span>	beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had
<span id="L6980" class="ln">  6980</span>	some sort of description of those rascals--&#39;twould help a good deal.
<span id="L6981" class="ln">  6981</span>	But you couldn&#39;t see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?&#34;
<span id="L6982" class="ln">  6982</span>	
<span id="L6983" class="ln">  6983</span>	&#34;Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them.&#34;
<span id="L6984" class="ln">  6984</span>	
<span id="L6985" class="ln">  6985</span>	&#34;Splendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!&#34;
<span id="L6986" class="ln">  6986</span>	
<span id="L6987" class="ln">  6987</span>	&#34;One&#39;s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that&#39;s ben around here once or
<span id="L6988" class="ln">  6988</span>	twice, and t&#39;other&#39;s a mean-looking, ragged--&#34;
<span id="L6989" class="ln">  6989</span>	
<span id="L6990" class="ln">  6990</span>	&#34;That&#39;s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods
<span id="L6991" class="ln">  6991</span>	back of the widow&#39;s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys,
<span id="L6992" class="ln">  6992</span>	and tell the sheriff--get your breakfast to-morrow morning!&#34;
<span id="L6993" class="ln">  6993</span>	
<span id="L6994" class="ln">  6994</span>	The Welshman&#39;s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room
<span id="L6995" class="ln">  6995</span>	Huck sprang up and exclaimed:
<span id="L6996" class="ln">  6996</span>	
<span id="L6997" class="ln">  6997</span>	&#34;Oh, please don&#39;t tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
<span id="L6998" class="ln">  6998</span>	please!&#34;
<span id="L6999" class="ln">  6999</span>	
<span id="L7000" class="ln">  7000</span>	&#34;All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of
<span id="L7001" class="ln">  7001</span>	what you did.&#34;
<span id="L7002" class="ln">  7002</span>	
<span id="L7003" class="ln">  7003</span>	&#34;Oh no, no! Please don&#39;t tell!&#34;
<span id="L7004" class="ln">  7004</span>	
<span id="L7005" class="ln">  7005</span>	When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:
<span id="L7006" class="ln">  7006</span>	
<span id="L7007" class="ln">  7007</span>	&#34;They won&#39;t tell--and I won&#39;t. But why don&#39;t you want it known?&#34;
<span id="L7008" class="ln">  7008</span>	
<span id="L7009" class="ln">  7009</span>	Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too
<span id="L7010" class="ln">  7010</span>	much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he
<span id="L7011" class="ln">  7011</span>	knew anything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for
<span id="L7012" class="ln">  7012</span>	knowing it, sure.
<span id="L7013" class="ln">  7013</span>	
<span id="L7014" class="ln">  7014</span>	The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:
<span id="L7015" class="ln">  7015</span>	
<span id="L7016" class="ln">  7016</span>	&#34;How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
<span id="L7017" class="ln">  7017</span>	suspicious?&#34;
<span id="L7018" class="ln">  7018</span>	
<span id="L7019" class="ln">  7019</span>	Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:
<span id="L7020" class="ln">  7020</span>	
<span id="L7021" class="ln">  7021</span>	&#34;Well, you see, I&#39;m a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so,
<span id="L7022" class="ln">  7022</span>	and I don&#39;t see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can&#39;t sleep much, on
<span id="L7023" class="ln">  7023</span>	account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way
<span id="L7024" class="ln">  7024</span>	of doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn&#39;t sleep, and so I
<span id="L7025" class="ln">  7025</span>	come along up-street &#39;bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I
<span id="L7026" class="ln">  7026</span>	got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed
<span id="L7027" class="ln">  7027</span>	up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes
<span id="L7028" class="ln">  7028</span>	these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their
<span id="L7029" class="ln">  7029</span>	arm, and I reckoned they&#39;d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t&#39;other one
<span id="L7030" class="ln">  7030</span>	wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
<span id="L7031" class="ln">  7031</span>	their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,
<span id="L7032" class="ln">  7032</span>	by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t&#39;other one was a
<span id="L7033" class="ln">  7033</span>	rusty, ragged-looking devil.&#34;
<span id="L7034" class="ln">  7034</span>	
<span id="L7035" class="ln">  7035</span>	&#34;Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?&#34;
<span id="L7036" class="ln">  7036</span>	
<span id="L7037" class="ln">  7037</span>	This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:
<span id="L7038" class="ln">  7038</span>	
<span id="L7039" class="ln">  7039</span>	&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know--but somehow it seems as if I did.&#34;
<span id="L7040" class="ln">  7040</span>	
<span id="L7041" class="ln">  7041</span>	&#34;Then they went on, and you--&#34;
<span id="L7042" class="ln">  7042</span>	
<span id="L7043" class="ln">  7043</span>	&#34;Follered &#39;em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they
<span id="L7044" class="ln">  7044</span>	sneaked along so. I dogged &#39;em to the widder&#39;s stile, and stood in the
<span id="L7045" class="ln">  7045</span>	dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard
<span id="L7046" class="ln">  7046</span>	swear he&#39;d spile her looks just as I told you and your two--&#34;
<span id="L7047" class="ln">  7047</span>	
<span id="L7048" class="ln">  7048</span>	&#34;What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!&#34;
<span id="L7049" class="ln">  7049</span>	
<span id="L7050" class="ln">  7050</span>	Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep
<span id="L7051" class="ln">  7051</span>	the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might
<span id="L7052" class="ln">  7052</span>	be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in
<span id="L7053" class="ln">  7053</span>	spite of all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his
<span id="L7054" class="ln">  7054</span>	scrape, but the old man&#39;s eye was upon him and he made blunder after
<span id="L7055" class="ln">  7055</span>	blunder. Presently the Welshman said:
<span id="L7056" class="ln">  7056</span>	
<span id="L7057" class="ln">  7057</span>	&#34;My boy, don&#39;t be afraid of me. I wouldn&#39;t hurt a hair of your head
<span id="L7058" class="ln">  7058</span>	for all the world. No--I&#39;d protect you--I&#39;d protect you. This Spaniard
<span id="L7059" class="ln">  7059</span>	is not deaf and dumb; you&#39;ve let that slip without intending it; you
<span id="L7060" class="ln">  7060</span>	can&#39;t cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that
<span id="L7061" class="ln">  7061</span>	you want to keep dark. Now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me
<span id="L7062" class="ln">  7062</span>	--I won&#39;t betray you.&#34;
<span id="L7063" class="ln">  7063</span>	
<span id="L7064" class="ln">  7064</span>	Huck looked into the old man&#39;s honest eyes a moment, then bent over
<span id="L7065" class="ln">  7065</span>	and whispered in his ear:
<span id="L7066" class="ln">  7066</span>	
<span id="L7067" class="ln">  7067</span>	&#34;&#39;Tain&#39;t a Spaniard--it&#39;s Injun Joe!&#34;
<span id="L7068" class="ln">  7068</span>	
<span id="L7069" class="ln">  7069</span>	The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:
<span id="L7070" class="ln">  7070</span>	
<span id="L7071" class="ln">  7071</span>	&#34;It&#39;s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and
<span id="L7072" class="ln">  7072</span>	slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because
<span id="L7073" class="ln">  7073</span>	white men don&#39;t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That&#39;s a
<span id="L7074" class="ln">  7074</span>	different matter altogether.&#34;
<span id="L7075" class="ln">  7075</span>	
<span id="L7076" class="ln">  7076</span>	During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
<span id="L7077" class="ln">  7077</span>	said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going
<span id="L7078" class="ln">  7078</span>	to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
<span id="L7079" class="ln">  7079</span>	marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--
<span id="L7080" class="ln">  7080</span>	
<span id="L7081" class="ln">  7081</span>	&#34;Of WHAT?&#34;
<span id="L7082" class="ln">  7082</span>	
<span id="L7083" class="ln">  7083</span>	If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
<span id="L7084" class="ln">  7084</span>	stunning suddenness from Huck&#39;s blanched lips. His eyes were staring
<span id="L7085" class="ln">  7085</span>	wide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer. The
<span id="L7086" class="ln">  7086</span>	Welshman started--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten
<span id="L7087" class="ln">  7087</span>	--then replied:
<span id="L7088" class="ln">  7088</span>	
<span id="L7089" class="ln">  7089</span>	&#34;Of burglar&#39;s tools. Why, what&#39;s the MATTER with you?&#34;
<span id="L7090" class="ln">  7090</span>	
<span id="L7091" class="ln">  7091</span>	Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
<span id="L7092" class="ln">  7092</span>	Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:
<span id="L7093" class="ln">  7093</span>	
<span id="L7094" class="ln">  7094</span>	&#34;Yes, burglar&#39;s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But
<span id="L7095" class="ln">  7095</span>	what did give you that turn? What were YOU expecting we&#39;d found?&#34;
<span id="L7096" class="ln">  7096</span>	
<span id="L7097" class="ln">  7097</span>	Huck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would
<span id="L7098" class="ln">  7098</span>	have given anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing
<span id="L7099" class="ln">  7099</span>	suggested itself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a
<span id="L7100" class="ln">  7100</span>	senseless reply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture
<span id="L7101" class="ln">  7101</span>	he uttered it--feebly:
<span id="L7102" class="ln">  7102</span>	
<span id="L7103" class="ln">  7103</span>	&#34;Sunday-school books, maybe.&#34;
<span id="L7104" class="ln">  7104</span>	
<span id="L7105" class="ln">  7105</span>	Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud
<span id="L7106" class="ln">  7106</span>	and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot,
<span id="L7107" class="ln">  7107</span>	and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man&#39;s pocket,
<span id="L7108" class="ln">  7108</span>	because it cut down the doctor&#39;s bill like everything. Then he added:
<span id="L7109" class="ln">  7109</span>	
<span id="L7110" class="ln">  7110</span>	&#34;Poor old chap, you&#39;re white and jaded--you ain&#39;t well a bit--no
<span id="L7111" class="ln">  7111</span>	wonder you&#39;re a little flighty and off your balance. But you&#39;ll come
<span id="L7112" class="ln">  7112</span>	out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.&#34;
<span id="L7113" class="ln">  7113</span>	
<span id="L7114" class="ln">  7114</span>	Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
<span id="L7115" class="ln">  7115</span>	a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
<span id="L7116" class="ln">  7116</span>	brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the
<span id="L7117" class="ln">  7117</span>	talk at the widow&#39;s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,
<span id="L7118" class="ln">  7118</span>	however--he had not known that it wasn&#39;t--and so the suggestion of a
<span id="L7119" class="ln">  7119</span>	captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole
<span id="L7120" class="ln">  7120</span>	he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond
<span id="L7121" class="ln">  7121</span>	all question that that bundle was not THE bundle, and so his mind was
<span id="L7122" class="ln">  7122</span>	at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be
<span id="L7123" class="ln">  7123</span>	drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still
<span id="L7124" class="ln">  7124</span>	in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom
<span id="L7125" class="ln">  7125</span>	could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
<span id="L7126" class="ln">  7126</span>	interruption.
<span id="L7127" class="ln">  7127</span>	
<span id="L7128" class="ln">  7128</span>	Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck
<span id="L7129" class="ln">  7129</span>	jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even
<span id="L7130" class="ln">  7130</span>	remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and
<span id="L7131" class="ln">  7131</span>	gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of
<span id="L7132" class="ln">  7132</span>	citizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile. So the news
<span id="L7133" class="ln">  7133</span>	had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
<span id="L7134" class="ln">  7134</span>	visitors. The widow&#39;s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.
<span id="L7135" class="ln">  7135</span>	
<span id="L7136" class="ln">  7136</span>	&#34;Don&#39;t say a word about it, madam. There&#39;s another that you&#39;re more
<span id="L7137" class="ln">  7137</span>	beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don&#39;t allow
<span id="L7138" class="ln">  7138</span>	me to tell his name. We wouldn&#39;t have been there but for him.&#34;
<span id="L7139" class="ln">  7139</span>	
<span id="L7140" class="ln">  7140</span>	Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled
<span id="L7141" class="ln">  7141</span>	the main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of
<span id="L7142" class="ln">  7142</span>	his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he
<span id="L7143" class="ln">  7143</span>	refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the
<span id="L7144" class="ln">  7144</span>	widow said:
<span id="L7145" class="ln">  7145</span>	
<span id="L7146" class="ln">  7146</span>	&#34;I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
<span id="L7147" class="ln">  7147</span>	noise. Why didn&#39;t you come and wake me?&#34;
<span id="L7148" class="ln">  7148</span>	
<span id="L7149" class="ln">  7149</span>	&#34;We judged it warn&#39;t worth while. Those fellows warn&#39;t likely to come
<span id="L7150" class="ln">  7150</span>	again--they hadn&#39;t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of
<span id="L7151" class="ln">  7151</span>	waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard
<span id="L7152" class="ln">  7152</span>	at your house all the rest of the night. They&#39;ve just come back.&#34;
<span id="L7153" class="ln">  7153</span>	
<span id="L7154" class="ln">  7154</span>	More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a
<span id="L7155" class="ln">  7155</span>	couple of hours more.
<span id="L7156" class="ln">  7156</span>	
<span id="L7157" class="ln">  7157</span>	There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
<span id="L7158" class="ln">  7158</span>	was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came
<span id="L7159" class="ln">  7159</span>	that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the
<span id="L7160" class="ln">  7160</span>	sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher&#39;s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.
<span id="L7161" class="ln">  7161</span>	Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:
<span id="L7162" class="ln">  7162</span>	
<span id="L7163" class="ln">  7163</span>	&#34;Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be
<span id="L7164" class="ln">  7164</span>	tired to death.&#34;
<span id="L7165" class="ln">  7165</span>	
<span id="L7166" class="ln">  7166</span>	&#34;Your Becky?&#34;
<span id="L7167" class="ln">  7167</span>	
<span id="L7168" class="ln">  7168</span>	&#34;Yes,&#34; with a startled look--&#34;didn&#39;t she stay with you last night?&#34;
<span id="L7169" class="ln">  7169</span>	
<span id="L7170" class="ln">  7170</span>	&#34;Why, no.&#34;
<span id="L7171" class="ln">  7171</span>	
<span id="L7172" class="ln">  7172</span>	Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,
<span id="L7173" class="ln">  7173</span>	talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:
<span id="L7174" class="ln">  7174</span>	
<span id="L7175" class="ln">  7175</span>	&#34;Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I&#39;ve got a
<span id="L7176" class="ln">  7176</span>	boy that&#39;s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last
<span id="L7177" class="ln">  7177</span>	night--one of you. And now he&#39;s afraid to come to church. I&#39;ve got to
<span id="L7178" class="ln">  7178</span>	settle with him.&#34;
<span id="L7179" class="ln">  7179</span>	
<span id="L7180" class="ln">  7180</span>	Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.
<span id="L7181" class="ln">  7181</span>	
<span id="L7182" class="ln">  7182</span>	&#34;He didn&#39;t stay with us,&#34; said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy.
<span id="L7183" class="ln">  7183</span>	A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly&#39;s face.
<span id="L7184" class="ln">  7184</span>	
<span id="L7185" class="ln">  7185</span>	&#34;Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?&#34;
<span id="L7186" class="ln">  7186</span>	
<span id="L7187" class="ln">  7187</span>	&#34;No&#39;m.&#34;
<span id="L7188" class="ln">  7188</span>	
<span id="L7189" class="ln">  7189</span>	&#34;When did you see him last?&#34;
<span id="L7190" class="ln">  7190</span>	
<span id="L7191" class="ln">  7191</span>	Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had
<span id="L7192" class="ln">  7192</span>	stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding
<span id="L7193" class="ln">  7193</span>	uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were
<span id="L7194" class="ln">  7194</span>	anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not
<span id="L7195" class="ln">  7195</span>	noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the
<span id="L7196" class="ln">  7196</span>	homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was
<span id="L7197" class="ln">  7197</span>	missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were
<span id="L7198" class="ln">  7198</span>	still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to
<span id="L7199" class="ln">  7199</span>	crying and wringing her hands.
<span id="L7200" class="ln">  7200</span>	
<span id="L7201" class="ln">  7201</span>	The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
<span id="L7202" class="ln">  7202</span>	street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the
<span id="L7203" class="ln">  7203</span>	whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant
<span id="L7204" class="ln">  7204</span>	insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled,
<span id="L7205" class="ln">  7205</span>	skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror
<span id="L7206" class="ln">  7206</span>	was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and
<span id="L7207" class="ln">  7207</span>	river toward the cave.
<span id="L7208" class="ln">  7208</span>	
<span id="L7209" class="ln">  7209</span>	All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women
<span id="L7210" class="ln">  7210</span>	visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They
<span id="L7211" class="ln">  7211</span>	cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the
<span id="L7212" class="ln">  7212</span>	tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
<span id="L7213" class="ln">  7213</span>	last, all the word that came was, &#34;Send more candles--and send food.&#34;
<span id="L7214" class="ln">  7214</span>	Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher
<span id="L7215" class="ln">  7215</span>	sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they
<span id="L7216" class="ln">  7216</span>	conveyed no real cheer.
<span id="L7217" class="ln">  7217</span>	
<span id="L7218" class="ln">  7218</span>	The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
<span id="L7219" class="ln">  7219</span>	candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck
<span id="L7220" class="ln">  7220</span>	still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
<span id="L7221" class="ln">  7221</span>	fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came
<span id="L7222" class="ln">  7222</span>	and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,
<span id="L7223" class="ln">  7223</span>	because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord&#39;s,
<span id="L7224" class="ln">  7224</span>	and nothing that was the Lord&#39;s was a thing to be neglected. The
<span id="L7225" class="ln">  7225</span>	Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:
<span id="L7226" class="ln">  7226</span>	
<span id="L7227" class="ln">  7227</span>	&#34;You can depend on it. That&#39;s the Lord&#39;s mark. He don&#39;t leave it off.
<span id="L7228" class="ln">  7228</span>	He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
<span id="L7229" class="ln">  7229</span>	hands.&#34;
<span id="L7230" class="ln">  7230</span>	
<span id="L7231" class="ln">  7231</span>	Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
<span id="L7232" class="ln">  7232</span>	village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the
<span id="L7233" class="ln">  7233</span>	news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were
<span id="L7234" class="ln">  7234</span>	being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner
<span id="L7235" class="ln">  7235</span>	and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one
<span id="L7236" class="ln">  7236</span>	wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting
<span id="L7237" class="ln">  7237</span>	hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent
<span id="L7238" class="ln">  7238</span>	their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one
<span id="L7239" class="ln">  7239</span>	place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names
<span id="L7240" class="ln">  7240</span>	&#34;BECKY &amp; TOM&#34; had been found traced upon the rocky wall with
<span id="L7241" class="ln">  7241</span>	candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs.
<span id="L7242" class="ln">  7242</span>	Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the
<span id="L7243" class="ln">  7243</span>	last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial
<span id="L7244" class="ln">  7244</span>	of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from
<span id="L7245" class="ln">  7245</span>	the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and
<span id="L7246" class="ln">  7246</span>	then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a
<span id="L7247" class="ln">  7247</span>	glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the
<span id="L7248" class="ln">  7248</span>	echoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the
<span id="L7249" class="ln">  7249</span>	children were not there; it was only a searcher&#39;s light.
<span id="L7250" class="ln">  7250</span>	
<span id="L7251" class="ln">  7251</span>	Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and
<span id="L7252" class="ln">  7252</span>	the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.
<span id="L7253" class="ln">  7253</span>	The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the
<span id="L7254" class="ln">  7254</span>	Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the
<span id="L7255" class="ln">  7255</span>	public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck
<span id="L7256" class="ln">  7256</span>	feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly
<span id="L7257" class="ln">  7257</span>	dreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance
<span id="L7258" class="ln">  7258</span>	Tavern since he had been ill.
<span id="L7259" class="ln">  7259</span>	
<span id="L7260" class="ln">  7260</span>	&#34;Yes,&#34; said the widow.
<span id="L7261" class="ln">  7261</span>	
<span id="L7262" class="ln">  7262</span>	Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:
<span id="L7263" class="ln">  7263</span>	
<span id="L7264" class="ln">  7264</span>	&#34;What? What was it?&#34;
<span id="L7265" class="ln">  7265</span>	
<span id="L7266" class="ln">  7266</span>	&#34;Liquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn
<span id="L7267" class="ln">  7267</span>	you did give me!&#34;
<span id="L7268" class="ln">  7268</span>	
<span id="L7269" class="ln">  7269</span>	&#34;Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer
<span id="L7270" class="ln">  7270</span>	that found it?&#34;
<span id="L7271" class="ln">  7271</span>	
<span id="L7272" class="ln">  7272</span>	The widow burst into tears. &#34;Hush, hush, child, hush! I&#39;ve told you
<span id="L7273" class="ln">  7273</span>	before, you must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!&#34;
<span id="L7274" class="ln">  7274</span>	
<span id="L7275" class="ln">  7275</span>	Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
<span id="L7276" class="ln">  7276</span>	powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever--gone
<span id="L7277" class="ln">  7277</span>	forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should
<span id="L7278" class="ln">  7278</span>	cry.
<span id="L7279" class="ln">  7279</span>	
<span id="L7280" class="ln">  7280</span>	These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck&#39;s mind, and under the
<span id="L7281" class="ln">  7281</span>	weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:
<span id="L7282" class="ln">  7282</span>	
<span id="L7283" class="ln">  7283</span>	&#34;There--he&#39;s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody
<span id="L7284" class="ln">  7284</span>	could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain&#39;t many left, now, that&#39;s got hope
<span id="L7285" class="ln">  7285</span>	enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.&#34;
<span id="L7286" class="ln">  7286</span>	
<span id="L7287" class="ln">  7287</span>	
<span id="L7288" class="ln">  7288</span>	
<span id="L7289" class="ln">  7289</span>	CHAPTER XXXI
<span id="L7290" class="ln">  7290</span>	
<span id="L7291" class="ln">  7291</span>	NOW to return to Tom and Becky&#39;s share in the picnic. They tripped
<span id="L7292" class="ln">  7292</span>	along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the
<span id="L7293" class="ln">  7293</span>	familiar wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather
<span id="L7294" class="ln">  7294</span>	over-descriptive names, such as &#34;The Drawing-Room,&#34; &#34;The Cathedral,&#34;
<span id="L7295" class="ln">  7295</span>	&#34;Aladdin&#39;s Palace,&#34; and so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking
<span id="L7296" class="ln">  7296</span>	began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion
<span id="L7297" class="ln">  7297</span>	began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous
<span id="L7298" class="ln">  7298</span>	avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled web-work of
<span id="L7299" class="ln">  7299</span>	names, dates, post-office addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky
<span id="L7300" class="ln">  7300</span>	walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and
<span id="L7301" class="ln">  7301</span>	talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave
<span id="L7302" class="ln">  7302</span>	whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an
<span id="L7303" class="ln">  7303</span>	overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a
<span id="L7304" class="ln">  7304</span>	little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone
<span id="L7305" class="ln">  7305</span>	sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and
<span id="L7306" class="ln">  7306</span>	ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his
<span id="L7307" class="ln">  7307</span>	small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky&#39;s
<span id="L7308" class="ln">  7308</span>	gratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural
<span id="L7309" class="ln">  7309</span>	stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the
<span id="L7310" class="ln">  7310</span>	ambition to be a discoverer seized him. Becky responded to his call,
<span id="L7311" class="ln">  7311</span>	and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their
<span id="L7312" class="ln">  7312</span>	quest. They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of
<span id="L7313" class="ln">  7313</span>	the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to
<span id="L7314" class="ln">  7314</span>	tell the upper world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern,
<span id="L7315" class="ln">  7315</span>	from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the
<span id="L7316" class="ln">  7316</span>	length and circumference of a man&#39;s leg; they walked all about it,
<span id="L7317" class="ln">  7317</span>	wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous
<span id="L7318" class="ln">  7318</span>	passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching
<span id="L7319" class="ln">  7319</span>	spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering
<span id="L7320" class="ln">  7320</span>	crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by
<span id="L7321" class="ln">  7321</span>	many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great
<span id="L7322" class="ln">  7322</span>	stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless
<span id="L7323" class="ln">  7323</span>	water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed
<span id="L7324" class="ln">  7324</span>	themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the
<span id="L7325" class="ln">  7325</span>	creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and
<span id="L7326" class="ln">  7326</span>	darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of
<span id="L7327" class="ln">  7327</span>	this sort of conduct. He seized Becky&#39;s hand and hurried her into the
<span id="L7328" class="ln">  7328</span>	first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck
<span id="L7329" class="ln">  7329</span>	Becky&#39;s light out with its wing while she was passing out of the
<span id="L7330" class="ln">  7330</span>	cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives
<span id="L7331" class="ln">  7331</span>	plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the
<span id="L7332" class="ln">  7332</span>	perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which
<span id="L7333" class="ln">  7333</span>	stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows.
<span id="L7334" class="ln">  7334</span>	He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best
<span id="L7335" class="ln">  7335</span>	to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep
<span id="L7336" class="ln">  7336</span>	stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
<span id="L7337" class="ln">  7337</span>	children. Becky said:
<span id="L7338" class="ln">  7338</span>	
<span id="L7339" class="ln">  7339</span>	&#34;Why, I didn&#39;t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of
<span id="L7340" class="ln">  7340</span>	the others.&#34;
<span id="L7341" class="ln">  7341</span>	
<span id="L7342" class="ln">  7342</span>	&#34;Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don&#39;t know
<span id="L7343" class="ln">  7343</span>	how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn&#39;t
<span id="L7344" class="ln">  7344</span>	hear them here.&#34;
<span id="L7345" class="ln">  7345</span>	
<span id="L7346" class="ln">  7346</span>	Becky grew apprehensive.
<span id="L7347" class="ln">  7347</span>	
<span id="L7348" class="ln">  7348</span>	&#34;I wonder how long we&#39;ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.&#34;
<span id="L7349" class="ln">  7349</span>	
<span id="L7350" class="ln">  7350</span>	&#34;Yes, I reckon we better. P&#39;raps we better.&#34;
<span id="L7351" class="ln">  7351</span>	
<span id="L7352" class="ln">  7352</span>	&#34;Can you find the way, Tom? It&#39;s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.&#34;
<span id="L7353" class="ln">  7353</span>	
<span id="L7354" class="ln">  7354</span>	&#34;I reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles
<span id="L7355" class="ln">  7355</span>	out it will be an awful fix. Let&#39;s try some other way, so as not to go
<span id="L7356" class="ln">  7356</span>	through there.&#34;
<span id="L7357" class="ln">  7357</span>	
<span id="L7358" class="ln">  7358</span>	&#34;Well. But I hope we won&#39;t get lost. It would be so awful!&#34; and the
<span id="L7359" class="ln">  7359</span>	girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.
<span id="L7360" class="ln">  7360</span>	
<span id="L7361" class="ln">  7361</span>	They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long
<span id="L7362" class="ln">  7362</span>	way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything
<span id="L7363" class="ln">  7363</span>	familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time
<span id="L7364" class="ln">  7364</span>	Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging
<span id="L7365" class="ln">  7365</span>	sign, and he would say cheerily:
<span id="L7366" class="ln">  7366</span>	
<span id="L7367" class="ln">  7367</span>	&#34;Oh, it&#39;s all right. This ain&#39;t the one, but we&#39;ll come to it right
<span id="L7368" class="ln">  7368</span>	away!&#34;
<span id="L7369" class="ln">  7369</span>	
<span id="L7370" class="ln">  7370</span>	But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently
<span id="L7371" class="ln">  7371</span>	began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate
<span id="L7372" class="ln">  7372</span>	hope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was &#34;all
<span id="L7373" class="ln">  7373</span>	right,&#34; but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words
<span id="L7374" class="ln">  7374</span>	had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, &#34;All is lost!&#34;
<span id="L7375" class="ln">  7375</span>	Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep
<span id="L7376" class="ln">  7376</span>	back the tears, but they would come. At last she said:
<span id="L7377" class="ln">  7377</span>	
<span id="L7378" class="ln">  7378</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let&#39;s go back that way! We seem to get
<span id="L7379" class="ln">  7379</span>	worse and worse off all the time.&#34;
<span id="L7380" class="ln">  7380</span>	
<span id="L7381" class="ln">  7381</span>	&#34;Listen!&#34; said he.
<span id="L7382" class="ln">  7382</span>	
<span id="L7383" class="ln">  7383</span>	Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were
<span id="L7384" class="ln">  7384</span>	conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the
<span id="L7385" class="ln">  7385</span>	empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
<span id="L7386" class="ln">  7386</span>	resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.
<span id="L7387" class="ln">  7387</span>	
<span id="L7388" class="ln">  7388</span>	&#34;Oh, don&#39;t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,&#34; said Becky.
<span id="L7389" class="ln">  7389</span>	
<span id="L7390" class="ln">  7390</span>	&#34;It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,&#34; and
<span id="L7391" class="ln">  7391</span>	he shouted again.
<span id="L7392" class="ln">  7392</span>	
<span id="L7393" class="ln">  7393</span>	The &#34;might&#34; was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it
<span id="L7394" class="ln">  7394</span>	so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened;
<span id="L7395" class="ln">  7395</span>	but there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and
<span id="L7396" class="ln">  7396</span>	hurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain
<span id="L7397" class="ln">  7397</span>	indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he
<span id="L7398" class="ln">  7398</span>	could not find his way back!
<span id="L7399" class="ln">  7399</span>	
<span id="L7400" class="ln">  7400</span>	&#34;Oh, Tom, you didn&#39;t make any marks!&#34;
<span id="L7401" class="ln">  7401</span>	
<span id="L7402" class="ln">  7402</span>	&#34;Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want
<span id="L7403" class="ln">  7403</span>	to come back! No--I can&#39;t find the way. It&#39;s all mixed up.&#34;
<span id="L7404" class="ln">  7404</span>	
<span id="L7405" class="ln">  7405</span>	&#34;Tom, Tom, we&#39;re lost! we&#39;re lost! We never can get out of this awful
<span id="L7406" class="ln">  7406</span>	place! Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!&#34;
<span id="L7407" class="ln">  7407</span>	
<span id="L7408" class="ln">  7408</span>	She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom
<span id="L7409" class="ln">  7409</span>	was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He
<span id="L7410" class="ln">  7410</span>	sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his
<span id="L7411" class="ln">  7411</span>	bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing
<span id="L7412" class="ln">  7412</span>	regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom
<span id="L7413" class="ln">  7413</span>	begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell
<span id="L7414" class="ln">  7414</span>	to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable
<span id="L7415" class="ln">  7415</span>	situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope
<span id="L7416" class="ln">  7416</span>	again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
<span id="L7417" class="ln">  7417</span>	would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than
<span id="L7418" class="ln">  7418</span>	she, she said.
<span id="L7419" class="ln">  7419</span>	
<span id="L7420" class="ln">  7420</span>	So they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do
<span id="L7421" class="ln">  7421</span>	was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of
<span id="L7422" class="ln">  7422</span>	reviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its
<span id="L7423" class="ln">  7423</span>	nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age
<span id="L7424" class="ln">  7424</span>	and familiarity with failure.
<span id="L7425" class="ln">  7425</span>	
<span id="L7426" class="ln">  7426</span>	By-and-by Tom took Becky&#39;s candle and blew it out. This economy meant
<span id="L7427" class="ln">  7427</span>	so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died
<span id="L7428" class="ln">  7428</span>	again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in
<span id="L7429" class="ln">  7429</span>	his pockets--yet he must economize.
<span id="L7430" class="ln">  7430</span>	
<span id="L7431" class="ln">  7431</span>	By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to
<span id="L7432" class="ln">  7432</span>	pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time
<span id="L7433" class="ln">  7433</span>	was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any
<span id="L7434" class="ln">  7434</span>	direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down
<span id="L7435" class="ln">  7435</span>	was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.
<span id="L7436" class="ln">  7436</span>	
<span id="L7437" class="ln">  7437</span>	At last Becky&#39;s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat
<span id="L7438" class="ln">  7438</span>	down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends
<span id="L7439" class="ln">  7439</span>	there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried,
<span id="L7440" class="ln">  7440</span>	and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his
<span id="L7441" class="ln">  7441</span>	encouragements were grown threadbare with use, and sounded like
<span id="L7442" class="ln">  7442</span>	sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to
<span id="L7443" class="ln">  7443</span>	sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it
<span id="L7444" class="ln">  7444</span>	grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and
<span id="L7445" class="ln">  7445</span>	by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected
<span id="L7446" class="ln">  7446</span>	somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts
<span id="L7447" class="ln">  7447</span>	wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in
<span id="L7448" class="ln">  7448</span>	his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh--but it was
<span id="L7449" class="ln">  7449</span>	stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.
<span id="L7450" class="ln">  7450</span>	
<span id="L7451" class="ln">  7451</span>	&#34;Oh, how COULD I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I
<span id="L7452" class="ln">  7452</span>	don&#39;t, Tom! Don&#39;t look so! I won&#39;t say it again.&#34;
<span id="L7453" class="ln">  7453</span>	
<span id="L7454" class="ln">  7454</span>	&#34;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve slept, Becky; you&#39;ll feel rested, now, and we&#39;ll find
<span id="L7455" class="ln">  7455</span>	the way out.&#34;
<span id="L7456" class="ln">  7456</span>	
<span id="L7457" class="ln">  7457</span>	&#34;We can try, Tom; but I&#39;ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream.
<span id="L7458" class="ln">  7458</span>	I reckon we are going there.&#34;
<span id="L7459" class="ln">  7459</span>	
<span id="L7460" class="ln">  7460</span>	&#34;Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let&#39;s go on trying.&#34;
<span id="L7461" class="ln">  7461</span>	
<span id="L7462" class="ln">  7462</span>	They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried
<span id="L7463" class="ln">  7463</span>	to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was
<span id="L7464" class="ln">  7464</span>	that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not
<span id="L7465" class="ln">  7465</span>	be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this--they
<span id="L7466" class="ln">  7466</span>	could not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for
<span id="L7467" class="ln">  7467</span>	dripping water--they must find a spring. They found one presently, and
<span id="L7468" class="ln">  7468</span>	Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky
<span id="L7469" class="ln">  7469</span>	said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to
<span id="L7470" class="ln">  7470</span>	hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom
<span id="L7471" class="ln">  7471</span>	fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay.
<span id="L7472" class="ln">  7472</span>	Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke
<span id="L7473" class="ln">  7473</span>	the silence:
<span id="L7474" class="ln">  7474</span>	
<span id="L7475" class="ln">  7475</span>	&#34;Tom, I am so hungry!&#34;
<span id="L7476" class="ln">  7476</span>	
<span id="L7477" class="ln">  7477</span>	Tom took something out of his pocket.
<span id="L7478" class="ln">  7478</span>	
<span id="L7479" class="ln">  7479</span>	&#34;Do you remember this?&#34; said he.
<span id="L7480" class="ln">  7480</span>	
<span id="L7481" class="ln">  7481</span>	Becky almost smiled.
<span id="L7482" class="ln">  7482</span>	
<span id="L7483" class="ln">  7483</span>	&#34;It&#39;s our wedding-cake, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L7484" class="ln">  7484</span>	
<span id="L7485" class="ln">  7485</span>	&#34;Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it&#39;s all we&#39;ve got.&#34;
<span id="L7486" class="ln">  7486</span>	
<span id="L7487" class="ln">  7487</span>	&#34;I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up
<span id="L7488" class="ln">  7488</span>	people do with wedding-cake--but it&#39;ll be our--&#34;
<span id="L7489" class="ln">  7489</span>	
<span id="L7490" class="ln">  7490</span>	She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky
<span id="L7491" class="ln">  7491</span>	ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was
<span id="L7492" class="ln">  7492</span>	abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky
<span id="L7493" class="ln">  7493</span>	suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he
<span id="L7494" class="ln">  7494</span>	said:
<span id="L7495" class="ln">  7495</span>	
<span id="L7496" class="ln">  7496</span>	&#34;Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?&#34;
<span id="L7497" class="ln">  7497</span>	
<span id="L7498" class="ln">  7498</span>	Becky&#39;s face paled, but she thought she could.
<span id="L7499" class="ln">  7499</span>	
<span id="L7500" class="ln">  7500</span>	&#34;Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there&#39;s water to drink.
<span id="L7501" class="ln">  7501</span>	That little piece is our last candle!&#34;
<span id="L7502" class="ln">  7502</span>	
<span id="L7503" class="ln">  7503</span>	Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to
<span id="L7504" class="ln">  7504</span>	comfort her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:
<span id="L7505" class="ln">  7505</span>	
<span id="L7506" class="ln">  7506</span>	&#34;Tom!&#34;
<span id="L7507" class="ln">  7507</span>	
<span id="L7508" class="ln">  7508</span>	&#34;Well, Becky?&#34;
<span id="L7509" class="ln">  7509</span>	
<span id="L7510" class="ln">  7510</span>	&#34;They&#39;ll miss us and hunt for us!&#34;
<span id="L7511" class="ln">  7511</span>	
<span id="L7512" class="ln">  7512</span>	&#34;Yes, they will! Certainly they will!&#34;
<span id="L7513" class="ln">  7513</span>	
<span id="L7514" class="ln">  7514</span>	&#34;Maybe they&#39;re hunting for us now, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L7515" class="ln">  7515</span>	
<span id="L7516" class="ln">  7516</span>	&#34;Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.&#34;
<span id="L7517" class="ln">  7517</span>	
<span id="L7518" class="ln">  7518</span>	&#34;When would they miss us, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L7519" class="ln">  7519</span>	
<span id="L7520" class="ln">  7520</span>	&#34;When they get back to the boat, I reckon.&#34;
<span id="L7521" class="ln">  7521</span>	
<span id="L7522" class="ln">  7522</span>	&#34;Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn&#39;t come?&#34;
<span id="L7523" class="ln">  7523</span>	
<span id="L7524" class="ln">  7524</span>	&#34;I don&#39;t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they
<span id="L7525" class="ln">  7525</span>	got home.&#34;
<span id="L7526" class="ln">  7526</span>	
<span id="L7527" class="ln">  7527</span>	A frightened look in Becky&#39;s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw
<span id="L7528" class="ln">  7528</span>	that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!
<span id="L7529" class="ln">  7529</span>	The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of
<span id="L7530" class="ln">  7530</span>	grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers
<span id="L7531" class="ln">  7531</span>	also--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher
<span id="L7532" class="ln">  7532</span>	discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper&#39;s.
<span id="L7533" class="ln">  7533</span>	
<span id="L7534" class="ln">  7534</span>	The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched
<span id="L7535" class="ln">  7535</span>	it melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand
<span id="L7536" class="ln">  7536</span>	alone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin
<span id="L7537" class="ln">  7537</span>	column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of
<span id="L7538" class="ln">  7538</span>	utter darkness reigned!
<span id="L7539" class="ln">  7539</span>	
<span id="L7540" class="ln">  7540</span>	How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that
<span id="L7541" class="ln">  7541</span>	she was crying in Tom&#39;s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew
<span id="L7542" class="ln">  7542</span>	was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of
<span id="L7543" class="ln">  7543</span>	a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said
<span id="L7544" class="ln">  7544</span>	it might be Sunday, now--maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk,
<span id="L7545" class="ln">  7545</span>	but her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said
<span id="L7546" class="ln">  7546</span>	that they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was
<span id="L7547" class="ln">  7547</span>	going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it;
<span id="L7548" class="ln">  7548</span>	but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he
<span id="L7549" class="ln">  7549</span>	tried it no more.
<span id="L7550" class="ln">  7550</span>	
<span id="L7551" class="ln">  7551</span>	The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again.
<span id="L7552" class="ln">  7552</span>	A portion of Tom&#39;s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it.
<span id="L7553" class="ln">  7553</span>	But they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only
<span id="L7554" class="ln">  7554</span>	whetted desire.
<span id="L7555" class="ln">  7555</span>	
<span id="L7556" class="ln">  7556</span>	By-and-by Tom said:
<span id="L7557" class="ln">  7557</span>	
<span id="L7558" class="ln">  7558</span>	&#34;SH! Did you hear that?&#34;
<span id="L7559" class="ln">  7559</span>	
<span id="L7560" class="ln">  7560</span>	Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the
<span id="L7561" class="ln">  7561</span>	faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky
<span id="L7562" class="ln">  7562</span>	by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction.
<span id="L7563" class="ln">  7563</span>	Presently he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently
<span id="L7564" class="ln">  7564</span>	a little nearer.
<span id="L7565" class="ln">  7565</span>	
<span id="L7566" class="ln">  7566</span>	&#34;It&#39;s them!&#34; said Tom; &#34;they&#39;re coming! Come along, Becky--we&#39;re all
<span id="L7567" class="ln">  7567</span>	right now!&#34;
<span id="L7568" class="ln">  7568</span>	
<span id="L7569" class="ln">  7569</span>	The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was
<span id="L7570" class="ln">  7570</span>	slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be
<span id="L7571" class="ln">  7571</span>	guarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be
<span id="L7572" class="ln">  7572</span>	three feet deep, it might be a hundred--there was no passing it at any
<span id="L7573" class="ln">  7573</span>	rate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could.
<span id="L7574" class="ln">  7574</span>	No bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They
<span id="L7575" class="ln">  7575</span>	listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a
<span id="L7576" class="ln">  7576</span>	moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking
<span id="L7577" class="ln">  7577</span>	misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He
<span id="L7578" class="ln">  7578</span>	talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
<span id="L7579" class="ln">  7579</span>	sounds came again.
<span id="L7580" class="ln">  7580</span>	
<span id="L7581" class="ln">  7581</span>	The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time
<span id="L7582" class="ln">  7582</span>	dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom
<span id="L7583" class="ln">  7583</span>	believed it must be Tuesday by this time.
<span id="L7584" class="ln">  7584</span>	
<span id="L7585" class="ln">  7585</span>	Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It
<span id="L7586" class="ln">  7586</span>	would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
<span id="L7587" class="ln">  7587</span>	heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to
<span id="L7588" class="ln">  7588</span>	a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the
<span id="L7589" class="ln">  7589</span>	line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
<span id="L7590" class="ln">  7590</span>	in a &#34;jumping-off place.&#34; Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and
<span id="L7591" class="ln">  7591</span>	then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
<span id="L7592" class="ln">  7592</span>	conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the
<span id="L7593" class="ln">  7593</span>	right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding
<span id="L7594" class="ln">  7594</span>	a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,
<span id="L7595" class="ln">  7595</span>	and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun
<span id="L7596" class="ln">  7596</span>	Joe&#39;s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified
<span id="L7597" class="ln">  7597</span>	the next moment, to see the &#34;Spaniard&#34; take to his heels and get
<span id="L7598" class="ln">  7598</span>	himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his
<span id="L7599" class="ln">  7599</span>	voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the
<span id="L7600" class="ln">  7600</span>	echoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he
<span id="L7601" class="ln">  7601</span>	reasoned. Tom&#39;s fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to
<span id="L7602" class="ln">  7602</span>	himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he
<span id="L7603" class="ln">  7603</span>	would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of
<span id="L7604" class="ln">  7604</span>	meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what it was
<span id="L7605" class="ln">  7605</span>	he had seen. He told her he had only shouted &#34;for luck.&#34;
<span id="L7606" class="ln">  7606</span>	
<span id="L7607" class="ln">  7607</span>	But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.
<span id="L7608" class="ln">  7608</span>	Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
<span id="L7609" class="ln">  7609</span>	changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed
<span id="L7610" class="ln">  7610</span>	that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,
<span id="L7611" class="ln">  7611</span>	and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another
<span id="L7612" class="ln">  7612</span>	passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But
<span id="L7613" class="ln">  7613</span>	Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be
<span id="L7614" class="ln">  7614</span>	roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die--it would
<span id="L7615" class="ln">  7615</span>	not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he
<span id="L7616" class="ln">  7616</span>	chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak
<span id="L7617" class="ln">  7617</span>	to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he
<span id="L7618" class="ln">  7618</span>	would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.
<span id="L7619" class="ln">  7619</span>	
<span id="L7620" class="ln">  7620</span>	Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a
<span id="L7621" class="ln">  7621</span>	show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the
<span id="L7622" class="ln">  7622</span>	cave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one
<span id="L7623" class="ln">  7623</span>	of the passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick
<span id="L7624" class="ln">  7624</span>	with bodings of coming doom.
<span id="L7625" class="ln">  7625</span>	
<span id="L7626" class="ln">  7626</span>	
<span id="L7627" class="ln">  7627</span>	
<span id="L7628" class="ln">  7628</span>	CHAPTER XXXII
<span id="L7629" class="ln">  7629</span>	
<span id="L7630" class="ln">  7630</span>	TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.
<span id="L7631" class="ln">  7631</span>	Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public
<span id="L7632" class="ln">  7632</span>	prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private
<span id="L7633" class="ln">  7633</span>	prayer that had the petitioner&#39;s whole heart in it; but still no good
<span id="L7634" class="ln">  7634</span>	news came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the
<span id="L7635" class="ln">  7635</span>	quest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain
<span id="L7636" class="ln">  7636</span>	the children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a
<span id="L7637" class="ln">  7637</span>	great part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to
<span id="L7638" class="ln">  7638</span>	hear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute
<span id="L7639" class="ln">  7639</span>	at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had
<span id="L7640" class="ln">  7640</span>	drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost
<span id="L7641" class="ln">  7641</span>	white. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.
<span id="L7642" class="ln">  7642</span>	
<span id="L7643" class="ln">  7643</span>	Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
<span id="L7644" class="ln">  7644</span>	bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad
<span id="L7645" class="ln">  7645</span>	people, who shouted, &#34;Turn out! turn out! they&#39;re found! they&#39;re
<span id="L7646" class="ln">  7646</span>	found!&#34; Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed
<span id="L7647" class="ln">  7647</span>	itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open
<span id="L7648" class="ln">  7648</span>	carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its
<span id="L7649" class="ln">  7649</span>	homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring
<span id="L7650" class="ln">  7650</span>	huzzah after huzzah!
<span id="L7651" class="ln">  7651</span>	
<span id="L7652" class="ln">  7652</span>	The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
<span id="L7653" class="ln">  7653</span>	greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour
<span id="L7654" class="ln">  7654</span>	a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher&#39;s house, seized
<span id="L7655" class="ln">  7655</span>	the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher&#39;s hand, tried to
<span id="L7656" class="ln">  7656</span>	speak but couldn&#39;t--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.
<span id="L7657" class="ln">  7657</span>	
<span id="L7658" class="ln">  7658</span>	Aunt Polly&#39;s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher&#39;s nearly so. It
<span id="L7659" class="ln">  7659</span>	would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with
<span id="L7660" class="ln">  7660</span>	the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay
<span id="L7661" class="ln">  7661</span>	upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of
<span id="L7662" class="ln">  7662</span>	the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it
<span id="L7663" class="ln">  7663</span>	withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on
<span id="L7664" class="ln">  7664</span>	an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
<span id="L7665" class="ln">  7665</span>	kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of
<span id="L7666" class="ln">  7666</span>	the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
<span id="L7667" class="ln">  7667</span>	speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,
<span id="L7668" class="ln">  7668</span>	pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad
<span id="L7669" class="ln">  7669</span>	Mississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would
<span id="L7670" class="ln">  7670</span>	not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that
<span id="L7671" class="ln">  7671</span>	passage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good
<span id="L7672" class="ln">  7672</span>	news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was
<span id="L7673" class="ln">  7673</span>	tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he
<span id="L7674" class="ln">  7674</span>	labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when
<span id="L7675" class="ln">  7675</span>	she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how
<span id="L7676" class="ln">  7676</span>	he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat
<span id="L7677" class="ln">  7677</span>	there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom
<span id="L7678" class="ln">  7678</span>	hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition;
<span id="L7679" class="ln">  7679</span>	how the men didn&#39;t believe the wild tale at first, &#34;because,&#34; said they,
<span id="L7680" class="ln">  7680</span>	&#34;you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in&#34;
<span id="L7681" class="ln">  7681</span>	--then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them
<span id="L7682" class="ln">  7682</span>	rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.
<span id="L7683" class="ln">  7683</span>	
<span id="L7684" class="ln">  7684</span>	Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
<span id="L7685" class="ln">  7685</span>	were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung
<span id="L7686" class="ln">  7686</span>	behind them, and informed of the great news.
<span id="L7687" class="ln">  7687</span>	
<span id="L7688" class="ln">  7688</span>	Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be
<span id="L7689" class="ln">  7689</span>	shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were
<span id="L7690" class="ln">  7690</span>	bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and
<span id="L7691" class="ln">  7691</span>	more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on
<span id="L7692" class="ln">  7692</span>	Thursday, was down-town Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday;
<span id="L7693" class="ln">  7693</span>	but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as
<span id="L7694" class="ln">  7694</span>	if she had passed through a wasting illness.
<span id="L7695" class="ln">  7695</span>	
<span id="L7696" class="ln">  7696</span>	Tom learned of Huck&#39;s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but
<span id="L7697" class="ln">  7697</span>	could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or
<span id="L7698" class="ln">  7698</span>	Sunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still
<span id="L7699" class="ln">  7699</span>	about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas
<span id="L7700" class="ln">  7700</span>	stayed by to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff
<span id="L7701" class="ln">  7701</span>	Hill event; also that the &#34;ragged man&#39;s&#34; body had eventually been found
<span id="L7702" class="ln">  7702</span>	in the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying
<span id="L7703" class="ln">  7703</span>	to escape, perhaps.
<span id="L7704" class="ln">  7704</span>	
<span id="L7705" class="ln">  7705</span>	About a fortnight after Tom&#39;s rescue from the cave, he started off to
<span id="L7706" class="ln">  7706</span>	visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting
<span id="L7707" class="ln">  7707</span>	talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge
<span id="L7708" class="ln">  7708</span>	Thatcher&#39;s house was on Tom&#39;s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The
<span id="L7709" class="ln">  7709</span>	Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him
<span id="L7710" class="ln">  7710</span>	ironically if he wouldn&#39;t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he
<span id="L7711" class="ln">  7711</span>	thought he wouldn&#39;t mind it. The Judge said:
<span id="L7712" class="ln">  7712</span>	
<span id="L7713" class="ln">  7713</span>	&#34;Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I&#39;ve not the least doubt.
<span id="L7714" class="ln">  7714</span>	But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any
<span id="L7715" class="ln">  7715</span>	more.&#34;
<span id="L7716" class="ln">  7716</span>	
<span id="L7717" class="ln">  7717</span>	&#34;Why?&#34;
<span id="L7718" class="ln">  7718</span>	
<span id="L7719" class="ln">  7719</span>	&#34;Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago,
<span id="L7720" class="ln">  7720</span>	and triple-locked--and I&#39;ve got the keys.&#34;
<span id="L7721" class="ln">  7721</span>	
<span id="L7722" class="ln">  7722</span>	Tom turned as white as a sheet.
<span id="L7723" class="ln">  7723</span>	
<span id="L7724" class="ln">  7724</span>	&#34;What&#39;s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!&#34;
<span id="L7725" class="ln">  7725</span>	
<span id="L7726" class="ln">  7726</span>	The water was brought and thrown into Tom&#39;s face.
<span id="L7727" class="ln">  7727</span>	
<span id="L7728" class="ln">  7728</span>	&#34;Ah, now you&#39;re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L7729" class="ln">  7729</span>	
<span id="L7730" class="ln">  7730</span>	&#34;Oh, Judge, Injun Joe&#39;s in the cave!&#34;
<span id="L7731" class="ln">  7731</span>	
<span id="L7732" class="ln">  7732</span>	
<span id="L7733" class="ln">  7733</span>	
<span id="L7734" class="ln">  7734</span>	CHAPTER XXXIII
<span id="L7735" class="ln">  7735</span>	
<span id="L7736" class="ln">  7736</span>	WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
<span id="L7737" class="ln">  7737</span>	men were on their way to McDougal&#39;s cave, and the ferryboat, well
<span id="L7738" class="ln">  7738</span>	filled with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that
<span id="L7739" class="ln">  7739</span>	bore Judge Thatcher.
<span id="L7740" class="ln">  7740</span>	
<span id="L7741" class="ln">  7741</span>	When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
<span id="L7742" class="ln">  7742</span>	the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
<span id="L7743" class="ln">  7743</span>	dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
<span id="L7744" class="ln">  7744</span>	eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
<span id="L7745" class="ln">  7745</span>	of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own
<span id="L7746" class="ln">  7746</span>	experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but
<span id="L7747" class="ln">  7747</span>	nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
<span id="L7748" class="ln">  7748</span>	which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
<span id="L7749" class="ln">  7749</span>	before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
<span id="L7750" class="ln">  7750</span>	he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.
<span id="L7751" class="ln">  7751</span>	
<span id="L7752" class="ln">  7752</span>	Injun Joe&#39;s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The
<span id="L7753" class="ln">  7753</span>	great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through,
<span id="L7754" class="ln">  7754</span>	with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock
<span id="L7755" class="ln">  7755</span>	formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had
<span id="L7756" class="ln">  7756</span>	wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if
<span id="L7757" class="ln">  7757</span>	there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been
<span id="L7758" class="ln">  7758</span>	useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could
<span id="L7759" class="ln">  7759</span>	not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had
<span id="L7760" class="ln">  7760</span>	only hacked that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass
<span id="L7761" class="ln">  7761</span>	the weary time--in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily
<span id="L7762" class="ln">  7762</span>	one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices
<span id="L7763" class="ln">  7763</span>	of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The
<span id="L7764" class="ln">  7764</span>	prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to
<span id="L7765" class="ln">  7765</span>	catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their
<span id="L7766" class="ln">  7766</span>	claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at
<span id="L7767" class="ln">  7767</span>	hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages,
<span id="L7768" class="ln">  7768</span>	builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had
<span id="L7769" class="ln">  7769</span>	broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone,
<span id="L7770" class="ln">  7770</span>	wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop
<span id="L7771" class="ln">  7771</span>	that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a
<span id="L7772" class="ln">  7772</span>	clock-tick--a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop
<span id="L7773" class="ln">  7773</span>	was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the
<span id="L7774" class="ln">  7774</span>	foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the
<span id="L7775" class="ln">  7775</span>	Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the
<span id="L7776" class="ln">  7776</span>	massacre at Lexington was &#34;news.&#34; It is falling now; it will still be
<span id="L7777" class="ln">  7777</span>	falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of
<span id="L7778" class="ln">  7778</span>	history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the
<span id="L7779" class="ln">  7779</span>	thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did
<span id="L7780" class="ln">  7780</span>	this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for
<span id="L7781" class="ln">  7781</span>	this flitting human insect&#39;s need? and has it another important object
<span id="L7782" class="ln">  7782</span>	to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and
<span id="L7783" class="ln">  7783</span>	many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch
<span id="L7784" class="ln">  7784</span>	the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that
<span id="L7785" class="ln">  7785</span>	pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the
<span id="L7786" class="ln">  7786</span>	wonders of McDougal&#39;s cave. Injun Joe&#39;s cup stands first in the list of
<span id="L7787" class="ln">  7787</span>	the cavern&#39;s marvels; even &#34;Aladdin&#39;s Palace&#34; cannot rival it.
<span id="L7788" class="ln">  7788</span>	
<span id="L7789" class="ln">  7789</span>	Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
<span id="L7790" class="ln">  7790</span>	there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
<span id="L7791" class="ln">  7791</span>	hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all
<span id="L7792" class="ln">  7792</span>	sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
<span id="L7793" class="ln">  7793</span>	satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
<span id="L7794" class="ln">  7794</span>	hanging.
<span id="L7795" class="ln">  7795</span>	
<span id="L7796" class="ln">  7796</span>	This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to
<span id="L7797" class="ln">  7797</span>	the governor for Injun Joe&#39;s pardon. The petition had been largely
<span id="L7798" class="ln">  7798</span>	signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a
<span id="L7799" class="ln">  7799</span>	committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail
<span id="L7800" class="ln">  7800</span>	around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample
<span id="L7801" class="ln">  7801</span>	his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five
<span id="L7802" class="ln">  7802</span>	citizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself
<span id="L7803" class="ln">  7803</span>	there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names
<span id="L7804" class="ln">  7804</span>	to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently
<span id="L7805" class="ln">  7805</span>	impaired and leaky water-works.
<span id="L7806" class="ln">  7806</span>	
<span id="L7807" class="ln">  7807</span>	The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
<span id="L7808" class="ln">  7808</span>	an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom&#39;s adventure from the
<span id="L7809" class="ln">  7809</span>	Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned
<span id="L7810" class="ln">  7810</span>	there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he
<span id="L7811" class="ln">  7811</span>	wanted to talk about now. Huck&#39;s face saddened. He said:
<span id="L7812" class="ln">  7812</span>	
<span id="L7813" class="ln">  7813</span>	&#34;I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but
<span id="L7814" class="ln">  7814</span>	whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must &#39;a&#39; ben
<span id="L7815" class="ln">  7815</span>	you, soon as I heard &#39;bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you
<span id="L7816" class="ln">  7816</span>	hadn&#39;t got the money becuz you&#39;d &#39;a&#39; got at me some way or other and
<span id="L7817" class="ln">  7817</span>	told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something&#39;s always
<span id="L7818" class="ln">  7818</span>	told me we&#39;d never get holt of that swag.&#34;
<span id="L7819" class="ln">  7819</span>	
<span id="L7820" class="ln">  7820</span>	&#34;Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. YOU know his tavern
<span id="L7821" class="ln">  7821</span>	was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don&#39;t you remember you
<span id="L7822" class="ln">  7822</span>	was to watch there that night?&#34;
<span id="L7823" class="ln">  7823</span>	
<span id="L7824" class="ln">  7824</span>	&#34;Oh yes! Why, it seems &#39;bout a year ago. It was that very night that I
<span id="L7825" class="ln">  7825</span>	follered Injun Joe to the widder&#39;s.&#34;
<span id="L7826" class="ln">  7826</span>	
<span id="L7827" class="ln">  7827</span>	&#34;YOU followed him?&#34;
<span id="L7828" class="ln">  7828</span>	
<span id="L7829" class="ln">  7829</span>	&#34;Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe&#39;s left friends behind him,
<span id="L7830" class="ln">  7830</span>	and I don&#39;t want &#39;em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it
<span id="L7831" class="ln">  7831</span>	hadn&#39;t ben for me he&#39;d be down in Texas now, all right.&#34;
<span id="L7832" class="ln">  7832</span>	
<span id="L7833" class="ln">  7833</span>	Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
<span id="L7834" class="ln">  7834</span>	heard of the Welshman&#39;s part of it before.
<span id="L7835" class="ln">  7835</span>	
<span id="L7836" class="ln">  7836</span>	&#34;Well,&#34; said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,
<span id="L7837" class="ln">  7837</span>	&#34;whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon
<span id="L7838" class="ln">  7838</span>	--anyways it&#39;s a goner for us, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L7839" class="ln">  7839</span>	
<span id="L7840" class="ln">  7840</span>	&#34;Huck, that money wasn&#39;t ever in No. 2!&#34;
<span id="L7841" class="ln">  7841</span>	
<span id="L7842" class="ln">  7842</span>	&#34;What!&#34; Huck searched his comrade&#39;s face keenly. &#34;Tom, have you got on
<span id="L7843" class="ln">  7843</span>	the track of that money again?&#34;
<span id="L7844" class="ln">  7844</span>	
<span id="L7845" class="ln">  7845</span>	&#34;Huck, it&#39;s in the cave!&#34;
<span id="L7846" class="ln">  7846</span>	
<span id="L7847" class="ln">  7847</span>	Huck&#39;s eyes blazed.
<span id="L7848" class="ln">  7848</span>	
<span id="L7849" class="ln">  7849</span>	&#34;Say it again, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L7850" class="ln">  7850</span>	
<span id="L7851" class="ln">  7851</span>	&#34;The money&#39;s in the cave!&#34;
<span id="L7852" class="ln">  7852</span>	
<span id="L7853" class="ln">  7853</span>	&#34;Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?&#34;
<span id="L7854" class="ln">  7854</span>	
<span id="L7855" class="ln">  7855</span>	&#34;Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go
<span id="L7856" class="ln">  7856</span>	in there with me and help get it out?&#34;
<span id="L7857" class="ln">  7857</span>	
<span id="L7858" class="ln">  7858</span>	&#34;I bet I will! I will if it&#39;s where we can blaze our way to it and not
<span id="L7859" class="ln">  7859</span>	get lost.&#34;
<span id="L7860" class="ln">  7860</span>	
<span id="L7861" class="ln">  7861</span>	&#34;Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
<span id="L7862" class="ln">  7862</span>	world.&#34;
<span id="L7863" class="ln">  7863</span>	
<span id="L7864" class="ln">  7864</span>	&#34;Good as wheat! What makes you think the money&#39;s--&#34;
<span id="L7865" class="ln">  7865</span>	
<span id="L7866" class="ln">  7866</span>	&#34;Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don&#39;t find it I&#39;ll
<span id="L7867" class="ln">  7867</span>	agree to give you my drum and every thing I&#39;ve got in the world. I
<span id="L7868" class="ln">  7868</span>	will, by jings.&#34;
<span id="L7869" class="ln">  7869</span>	
<span id="L7870" class="ln">  7870</span>	&#34;All right--it&#39;s a whiz. When do you say?&#34;
<span id="L7871" class="ln">  7871</span>	
<span id="L7872" class="ln">  7872</span>	&#34;Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?&#34;
<span id="L7873" class="ln">  7873</span>	
<span id="L7874" class="ln">  7874</span>	&#34;Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
<span id="L7875" class="ln">  7875</span>	now, but I can&#39;t walk more&#39;n a mile, Tom--least I don&#39;t think I could.&#34;
<span id="L7876" class="ln">  7876</span>	
<span id="L7877" class="ln">  7877</span>	&#34;It&#39;s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go,
<span id="L7878" class="ln">  7878</span>	Huck, but there&#39;s a mighty short cut that they don&#39;t anybody but me
<span id="L7879" class="ln">  7879</span>	know about. Huck, I&#39;ll take you right to it in a skiff. I&#39;ll float the
<span id="L7880" class="ln">  7880</span>	skiff down there, and I&#39;ll pull it back again all by myself. You
<span id="L7881" class="ln">  7881</span>	needn&#39;t ever turn your hand over.&#34;
<span id="L7882" class="ln">  7882</span>	
<span id="L7883" class="ln">  7883</span>	&#34;Less start right off, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L7884" class="ln">  7884</span>	
<span id="L7885" class="ln">  7885</span>	&#34;All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little
<span id="L7886" class="ln">  7886</span>	bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these
<span id="L7887" class="ln">  7887</span>	new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many&#39;s
<span id="L7888" class="ln">  7888</span>	the time I wished I had some when I was in there before.&#34;
<span id="L7889" class="ln">  7889</span>	
<span id="L7890" class="ln">  7890</span>	A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
<span id="L7891" class="ln">  7891</span>	was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles
<span id="L7892" class="ln">  7892</span>	below &#34;Cave Hollow,&#34; Tom said:
<span id="L7893" class="ln">  7893</span>	
<span id="L7894" class="ln">  7894</span>	&#34;Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
<span id="L7895" class="ln">  7895</span>	cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see
<span id="L7896" class="ln">  7896</span>	that white place up yonder where there&#39;s been a landslide? Well, that&#39;s
<span id="L7897" class="ln">  7897</span>	one of my marks. We&#39;ll get ashore, now.&#34;
<span id="L7898" class="ln">  7898</span>	
<span id="L7899" class="ln">  7899</span>	They landed.
<span id="L7900" class="ln">  7900</span>	
<span id="L7901" class="ln">  7901</span>	&#34;Now, Huck, where we&#39;re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out
<span id="L7902" class="ln">  7902</span>	of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.&#34;
<span id="L7903" class="ln">  7903</span>	
<span id="L7904" class="ln">  7904</span>	Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly
<span id="L7905" class="ln">  7905</span>	marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:
<span id="L7906" class="ln">  7906</span>	
<span id="L7907" class="ln">  7907</span>	&#34;Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it&#39;s the snuggest hole in this
<span id="L7908" class="ln">  7908</span>	country. You just keep mum about it. All along I&#39;ve been wanting to be
<span id="L7909" class="ln">  7909</span>	a robber, but I knew I&#39;d got to have a thing like this, and where to
<span id="L7910" class="ln">  7910</span>	run across it was the bother. We&#39;ve got it now, and we&#39;ll keep it
<span id="L7911" class="ln">  7911</span>	quiet, only we&#39;ll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course
<span id="L7912" class="ln">  7912</span>	there&#39;s got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn&#39;t be any style about it.
<span id="L7913" class="ln">  7913</span>	Tom Sawyer&#39;s Gang--it sounds splendid, don&#39;t it, Huck?&#34;
<span id="L7914" class="ln">  7914</span>	
<span id="L7915" class="ln">  7915</span>	&#34;Well, it just does, Tom. And who&#39;ll we rob?&#34;
<span id="L7916" class="ln">  7916</span>	
<span id="L7917" class="ln">  7917</span>	&#34;Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that&#39;s mostly the way.&#34;
<span id="L7918" class="ln">  7918</span>	
<span id="L7919" class="ln">  7919</span>	&#34;And kill them?&#34;
<span id="L7920" class="ln">  7920</span>	
<span id="L7921" class="ln">  7921</span>	&#34;No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.&#34;
<span id="L7922" class="ln">  7922</span>	
<span id="L7923" class="ln">  7923</span>	&#34;What&#39;s a ransom?&#34;
<span id="L7924" class="ln">  7924</span>	
<span id="L7925" class="ln">  7925</span>	&#34;Money. You make them raise all they can, off&#39;n their friends; and
<span id="L7926" class="ln">  7926</span>	after you&#39;ve kept them a year, if it ain&#39;t raised then you kill them.
<span id="L7927" class="ln">  7927</span>	That&#39;s the general way. Only you don&#39;t kill the women. You shut up the
<span id="L7928" class="ln">  7928</span>	women, but you don&#39;t kill them. They&#39;re always beautiful and rich, and
<span id="L7929" class="ln">  7929</span>	awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take
<span id="L7930" class="ln">  7930</span>	your hat off and talk polite. They ain&#39;t anybody as polite as robbers
<span id="L7931" class="ln">  7931</span>	--you&#39;ll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and
<span id="L7932" class="ln">  7932</span>	after they&#39;ve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and
<span id="L7933" class="ln">  7933</span>	after that you couldn&#39;t get them to leave. If you drove them out they&#39;d
<span id="L7934" class="ln">  7934</span>	turn right around and come back. It&#39;s so in all the books.&#34;
<span id="L7935" class="ln">  7935</span>	
<span id="L7936" class="ln">  7936</span>	&#34;Why, it&#39;s real bully, Tom. I believe it&#39;s better&#39;n to be a pirate.&#34;
<span id="L7937" class="ln">  7937</span>	
<span id="L7938" class="ln">  7938</span>	&#34;Yes, it&#39;s better in some ways, because it&#39;s close to home and
<span id="L7939" class="ln">  7939</span>	circuses and all that.&#34;
<span id="L7940" class="ln">  7940</span>	
<span id="L7941" class="ln">  7941</span>	By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom
<span id="L7942" class="ln">  7942</span>	in the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel,
<span id="L7943" class="ln">  7943</span>	then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps
<span id="L7944" class="ln">  7944</span>	brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through
<span id="L7945" class="ln">  7945</span>	him. He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of
<span id="L7946" class="ln">  7946</span>	clay against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the
<span id="L7947" class="ln">  7947</span>	flame struggle and expire.
<span id="L7948" class="ln">  7948</span>	
<span id="L7949" class="ln">  7949</span>	The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and
<span id="L7950" class="ln">  7950</span>	gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently
<span id="L7951" class="ln">  7951</span>	entered and followed Tom&#39;s other corridor until they reached the
<span id="L7952" class="ln">  7952</span>	&#34;jumping-off place.&#34; The candles revealed the fact that it was not
<span id="L7953" class="ln">  7953</span>	really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
<span id="L7954" class="ln">  7954</span>	high. Tom whispered:
<span id="L7955" class="ln">  7955</span>	
<span id="L7956" class="ln">  7956</span>	&#34;Now I&#39;ll show you something, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L7957" class="ln">  7957</span>	
<span id="L7958" class="ln">  7958</span>	He held his candle aloft and said:
<span id="L7959" class="ln">  7959</span>	
<span id="L7960" class="ln">  7960</span>	&#34;Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on
<span id="L7961" class="ln">  7961</span>	the big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.&#34;
<span id="L7962" class="ln">  7962</span>	
<span id="L7963" class="ln">  7963</span>	&#34;Tom, it&#39;s a CROSS!&#34;
<span id="L7964" class="ln">  7964</span>	
<span id="L7965" class="ln">  7965</span>	&#34;NOW where&#39;s your Number Two? &#39;UNDER THE CROSS,&#39; hey? Right yonder&#39;s
<span id="L7966" class="ln">  7966</span>	where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!&#34;
<span id="L7967" class="ln">  7967</span>	
<span id="L7968" class="ln">  7968</span>	Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:
<span id="L7969" class="ln">  7969</span>	
<span id="L7970" class="ln">  7970</span>	&#34;Tom, less git out of here!&#34;
<span id="L7971" class="ln">  7971</span>	
<span id="L7972" class="ln">  7972</span>	&#34;What! and leave the treasure?&#34;
<span id="L7973" class="ln">  7973</span>	
<span id="L7974" class="ln">  7974</span>	&#34;Yes--leave it. Injun Joe&#39;s ghost is round about there, certain.&#34;
<span id="L7975" class="ln">  7975</span>	
<span id="L7976" class="ln">  7976</span>	&#34;No it ain&#39;t, Huck, no it ain&#39;t. It would ha&#39;nt the place where he
<span id="L7977" class="ln">  7977</span>	died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.&#34;
<span id="L7978" class="ln">  7978</span>	
<span id="L7979" class="ln">  7979</span>	&#34;No, Tom, it wouldn&#39;t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways
<span id="L7980" class="ln">  7980</span>	of ghosts, and so do you.&#34;
<span id="L7981" class="ln">  7981</span>	
<span id="L7982" class="ln">  7982</span>	Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his
<span id="L7983" class="ln">  7983</span>	mind. But presently an idea occurred to him--
<span id="L7984" class="ln">  7984</span>	
<span id="L7985" class="ln">  7985</span>	&#34;Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we&#39;re making of ourselves! Injun Joe&#39;s
<span id="L7986" class="ln">  7986</span>	ghost ain&#39;t a going to come around where there&#39;s a cross!&#34;
<span id="L7987" class="ln">  7987</span>	
<span id="L7988" class="ln">  7988</span>	The point was well taken. It had its effect.
<span id="L7989" class="ln">  7989</span>	
<span id="L7990" class="ln">  7990</span>	&#34;Tom, I didn&#39;t think of that. But that&#39;s so. It&#39;s luck for us, that
<span id="L7991" class="ln">  7991</span>	cross is. I reckon we&#39;ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.&#34;
<span id="L7992" class="ln">  7992</span>	
<span id="L7993" class="ln">  7993</span>	Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.
<span id="L7994" class="ln">  7994</span>	Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
<span id="L7995" class="ln">  7995</span>	great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.
<span id="L7996" class="ln">  7996</span>	They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with
<span id="L7997" class="ln">  7997</span>	a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some
<span id="L7998" class="ln">  7998</span>	bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there
<span id="L7999" class="ln">  7999</span>	was no money-box. The lads searched and researched this place, but in
<span id="L8000" class="ln">  8000</span>	vain. Tom said:
<span id="L8001" class="ln">  8001</span>	
<span id="L8002" class="ln">  8002</span>	&#34;He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the
<span id="L8003" class="ln">  8003</span>	cross. It can&#39;t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on
<span id="L8004" class="ln">  8004</span>	the ground.&#34;
<span id="L8005" class="ln">  8005</span>	
<span id="L8006" class="ln">  8006</span>	They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged.
<span id="L8007" class="ln">  8007</span>	Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:
<span id="L8008" class="ln">  8008</span>	
<span id="L8009" class="ln">  8009</span>	&#34;Lookyhere, Huck, there&#39;s footprints and some candle-grease on the
<span id="L8010" class="ln">  8010</span>	clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now,
<span id="L8011" class="ln">  8011</span>	what&#39;s that for? I bet you the money IS under the rock. I&#39;m going to
<span id="L8012" class="ln">  8012</span>	dig in the clay.&#34;
<span id="L8013" class="ln">  8013</span>	
<span id="L8014" class="ln">  8014</span>	&#34;That ain&#39;t no bad notion, Tom!&#34; said Huck with animation.
<span id="L8015" class="ln">  8015</span>	
<span id="L8016" class="ln">  8016</span>	Tom&#39;s &#34;real Barlow&#34; was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
<span id="L8017" class="ln">  8017</span>	before he struck wood.
<span id="L8018" class="ln">  8018</span>	
<span id="L8019" class="ln">  8019</span>	&#34;Hey, Huck!--you hear that?&#34;
<span id="L8020" class="ln">  8020</span>	
<span id="L8021" class="ln">  8021</span>	Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and
<span id="L8022" class="ln">  8022</span>	removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.
<span id="L8023" class="ln">  8023</span>	Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he
<span id="L8024" class="ln">  8024</span>	could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to
<span id="L8025" class="ln">  8025</span>	explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended
<span id="L8026" class="ln">  8026</span>	gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to
<span id="L8027" class="ln">  8027</span>	the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and
<span id="L8028" class="ln">  8028</span>	exclaimed:
<span id="L8029" class="ln">  8029</span>	
<span id="L8030" class="ln">  8030</span>	&#34;My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!&#34;
<span id="L8031" class="ln">  8031</span>	
<span id="L8032" class="ln">  8032</span>	It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,
<span id="L8033" class="ln">  8033</span>	along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two
<span id="L8034" class="ln">  8034</span>	or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish
<span id="L8035" class="ln">  8035</span>	well soaked with the water-drip.
<span id="L8036" class="ln">  8036</span>	
<span id="L8037" class="ln">  8037</span>	&#34;Got it at last!&#34; said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with
<span id="L8038" class="ln">  8038</span>	his hand. &#34;My, but we&#39;re rich, Tom!&#34;
<span id="L8039" class="ln">  8039</span>	
<span id="L8040" class="ln">  8040</span>	&#34;Huck, I always reckoned we&#39;d get it. It&#39;s just too good to believe,
<span id="L8041" class="ln">  8041</span>	but we HAVE got it, sure! Say--let&#39;s not fool around here. Let&#39;s snake
<span id="L8042" class="ln">  8042</span>	it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.&#34;
<span id="L8043" class="ln">  8043</span>	
<span id="L8044" class="ln">  8044</span>	It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward
<span id="L8045" class="ln">  8045</span>	fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.
<span id="L8046" class="ln">  8046</span>	
<span id="L8047" class="ln">  8047</span>	&#34;I thought so,&#34; he said; &#34;THEY carried it like it was heavy, that day
<span id="L8048" class="ln">  8048</span>	at the ha&#39;nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of
<span id="L8049" class="ln">  8049</span>	fetching the little bags along.&#34;
<span id="L8050" class="ln">  8050</span>	
<span id="L8051" class="ln">  8051</span>	The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
<span id="L8052" class="ln">  8052</span>	rock.
<span id="L8053" class="ln">  8053</span>	
<span id="L8054" class="ln">  8054</span>	&#34;Now less fetch the guns and things,&#34; said Huck.
<span id="L8055" class="ln">  8055</span>	
<span id="L8056" class="ln">  8056</span>	&#34;No, Huck--leave them there. They&#39;re just the tricks to have when we
<span id="L8057" class="ln">  8057</span>	go to robbing. We&#39;ll keep them there all the time, and we&#39;ll hold our
<span id="L8058" class="ln">  8058</span>	orgies there, too. It&#39;s an awful snug place for orgies.&#34;
<span id="L8059" class="ln">  8059</span>	
<span id="L8060" class="ln">  8060</span>	&#34;What orgies?&#34;
<span id="L8061" class="ln">  8061</span>	
<span id="L8062" class="ln">  8062</span>	&#34;I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we&#39;ve got to
<span id="L8063" class="ln">  8063</span>	have them, too. Come along, Huck, we&#39;ve been in here a long time. It&#39;s
<span id="L8064" class="ln">  8064</span>	getting late, I reckon. I&#39;m hungry, too. We&#39;ll eat and smoke when we
<span id="L8065" class="ln">  8065</span>	get to the skiff.&#34;
<span id="L8066" class="ln">  8066</span>	
<span id="L8067" class="ln">  8067</span>	They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily
<span id="L8068" class="ln">  8068</span>	out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the
<span id="L8069" class="ln">  8069</span>	skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
<span id="L8070" class="ln">  8070</span>	under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting
<span id="L8071" class="ln">  8071</span>	cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.
<span id="L8072" class="ln">  8072</span>	
<span id="L8073" class="ln">  8073</span>	&#34;Now, Huck,&#34; said Tom, &#34;we&#39;ll hide the money in the loft of the
<span id="L8074" class="ln">  8074</span>	widow&#39;s woodshed, and I&#39;ll come up in the morning and we&#39;ll count it
<span id="L8075" class="ln">  8075</span>	and divide, and then we&#39;ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it
<span id="L8076" class="ln">  8076</span>	where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till
<span id="L8077" class="ln">  8077</span>	I run and hook Benny Taylor&#39;s little wagon; I won&#39;t be gone a minute.&#34;
<span id="L8078" class="ln">  8078</span>	
<span id="L8079" class="ln">  8079</span>	He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two
<span id="L8080" class="ln">  8080</span>	small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started
<span id="L8081" class="ln">  8081</span>	off, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the
<span id="L8082" class="ln">  8082</span>	Welshman&#39;s house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move
<span id="L8083" class="ln">  8083</span>	on, the Welshman stepped out and said:
<span id="L8084" class="ln">  8084</span>	
<span id="L8085" class="ln">  8085</span>	&#34;Hallo, who&#39;s that?&#34;
<span id="L8086" class="ln">  8086</span>	
<span id="L8087" class="ln">  8087</span>	&#34;Huck and Tom Sawyer.&#34;
<span id="L8088" class="ln">  8088</span>	
<span id="L8089" class="ln">  8089</span>	&#34;Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.
<span id="L8090" class="ln">  8090</span>	Here--hurry up, trot ahead--I&#39;ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it&#39;s not
<span id="L8091" class="ln">  8091</span>	as light as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?&#34;
<span id="L8092" class="ln">  8092</span>	
<span id="L8093" class="ln">  8093</span>	&#34;Old metal,&#34; said Tom.
<span id="L8094" class="ln">  8094</span>	
<span id="L8095" class="ln">  8095</span>	&#34;I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool
<span id="L8096" class="ln">  8096</span>	away more time hunting up six bits&#39; worth of old iron to sell to the
<span id="L8097" class="ln">  8097</span>	foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But
<span id="L8098" class="ln">  8098</span>	that&#39;s human nature--hurry along, hurry along!&#34;
<span id="L8099" class="ln">  8099</span>	
<span id="L8100" class="ln">  8100</span>	The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.
<span id="L8101" class="ln">  8101</span>	
<span id="L8102" class="ln">  8102</span>	&#34;Never mind; you&#39;ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas&#39;.&#34;
<span id="L8103" class="ln">  8103</span>	
<span id="L8104" class="ln">  8104</span>	Huck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being
<span id="L8105" class="ln">  8105</span>	falsely accused:
<span id="L8106" class="ln">  8106</span>	
<span id="L8107" class="ln">  8107</span>	&#34;Mr. Jones, we haven&#39;t been doing nothing.&#34;
<span id="L8108" class="ln">  8108</span>	
<span id="L8109" class="ln">  8109</span>	The Welshman laughed.
<span id="L8110" class="ln">  8110</span>	
<span id="L8111" class="ln">  8111</span>	&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know, Huck, my boy. I don&#39;t know about that. Ain&#39;t you
<span id="L8112" class="ln">  8112</span>	and the widow good friends?&#34;
<span id="L8113" class="ln">  8113</span>	
<span id="L8114" class="ln">  8114</span>	&#34;Yes. Well, she&#39;s ben good friends to me, anyway.&#34;
<span id="L8115" class="ln">  8115</span>	
<span id="L8116" class="ln">  8116</span>	&#34;All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?&#34;
<span id="L8117" class="ln">  8117</span>	
<span id="L8118" class="ln">  8118</span>	This question was not entirely answered in Huck&#39;s slow mind before he
<span id="L8119" class="ln">  8119</span>	found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas&#39; drawing-room.
<span id="L8120" class="ln">  8120</span>	Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.
<span id="L8121" class="ln">  8121</span>	
<span id="L8122" class="ln">  8122</span>	The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any
<span id="L8123" class="ln">  8123</span>	consequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the
<span id="L8124" class="ln">  8124</span>	Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor,
<span id="L8125" class="ln">  8125</span>	and a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow
<span id="L8126" class="ln">  8126</span>	received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such
<span id="L8127" class="ln">  8127</span>	looking beings. They were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt
<span id="L8128" class="ln">  8128</span>	Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head
<span id="L8129" class="ln">  8129</span>	at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr.
<span id="L8130" class="ln">  8130</span>	Jones said:
<span id="L8131" class="ln">  8131</span>	
<span id="L8132" class="ln">  8132</span>	&#34;Tom wasn&#39;t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and
<span id="L8133" class="ln">  8133</span>	Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.&#34;
<span id="L8134" class="ln">  8134</span>	
<span id="L8135" class="ln">  8135</span>	&#34;And you did just right,&#34; said the widow. &#34;Come with me, boys.&#34;
<span id="L8136" class="ln">  8136</span>	
<span id="L8137" class="ln">  8137</span>	She took them to a bedchamber and said:
<span id="L8138" class="ln">  8138</span>	
<span id="L8139" class="ln">  8139</span>	&#34;Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes
<span id="L8140" class="ln">  8140</span>	--shirts, socks, everything complete. They&#39;re Huck&#39;s--no, no thanks,
<span id="L8141" class="ln">  8141</span>	Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they&#39;ll fit both of you.
<span id="L8142" class="ln">  8142</span>	Get into them. We&#39;ll wait--come down when you are slicked up enough.&#34;
<span id="L8143" class="ln">  8143</span>	
<span id="L8144" class="ln">  8144</span>	Then she left.
<span id="L8145" class="ln">  8145</span>	
<span id="L8146" class="ln">  8146</span>	
<span id="L8147" class="ln">  8147</span>	
<span id="L8148" class="ln">  8148</span>	CHAPTER XXXIV
<span id="L8149" class="ln">  8149</span>	
<span id="L8150" class="ln">  8150</span>	HUCK said: &#34;Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain&#39;t
<span id="L8151" class="ln">  8151</span>	high from the ground.&#34;
<span id="L8152" class="ln">  8152</span>	
<span id="L8153" class="ln">  8153</span>	&#34;Shucks! what do you want to slope for?&#34;
<span id="L8154" class="ln">  8154</span>	
<span id="L8155" class="ln">  8155</span>	&#34;Well, I ain&#39;t used to that kind of a crowd. I can&#39;t stand it. I ain&#39;t
<span id="L8156" class="ln">  8156</span>	going down there, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L8157" class="ln">  8157</span>	
<span id="L8158" class="ln">  8158</span>	&#34;Oh, bother! It ain&#39;t anything. I don&#39;t mind it a bit. I&#39;ll take care
<span id="L8159" class="ln">  8159</span>	of you.&#34;
<span id="L8160" class="ln">  8160</span>	
<span id="L8161" class="ln">  8161</span>	Sid appeared.
<span id="L8162" class="ln">  8162</span>	
<span id="L8163" class="ln">  8163</span>	&#34;Tom,&#34; said he, &#34;auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.
<span id="L8164" class="ln">  8164</span>	Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody&#39;s been fretting about
<span id="L8165" class="ln">  8165</span>	you. Say--ain&#39;t this grease and clay, on your clothes?&#34;
<span id="L8166" class="ln">  8166</span>	
<span id="L8167" class="ln">  8167</span>	&#34;Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist &#39;tend to your own business. What&#39;s all this
<span id="L8168" class="ln">  8168</span>	blow-out about, anyway?&#34;
<span id="L8169" class="ln">  8169</span>	
<span id="L8170" class="ln">  8170</span>	&#34;It&#39;s one of the widow&#39;s parties that she&#39;s always having. This time
<span id="L8171" class="ln">  8171</span>	it&#39;s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
<span id="L8172" class="ln">  8172</span>	helped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something,
<span id="L8173" class="ln">  8173</span>	if you want to know.&#34;
<span id="L8174" class="ln">  8174</span>	
<span id="L8175" class="ln">  8175</span>	&#34;Well, what?&#34;
<span id="L8176" class="ln">  8176</span>	
<span id="L8177" class="ln">  8177</span>	&#34;Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people
<span id="L8178" class="ln">  8178</span>	here to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it, as a
<span id="L8179" class="ln">  8179</span>	secret, but I reckon it&#39;s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows
<span id="L8180" class="ln">  8180</span>	--the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don&#39;t. Mr. Jones was
<span id="L8181" class="ln">  8181</span>	bound Huck should be here--couldn&#39;t get along with his grand secret
<span id="L8182" class="ln">  8182</span>	without Huck, you know!&#34;
<span id="L8183" class="ln">  8183</span>	
<span id="L8184" class="ln">  8184</span>	&#34;Secret about what, Sid?&#34;
<span id="L8185" class="ln">  8185</span>	
<span id="L8186" class="ln">  8186</span>	&#34;About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow&#39;s. I reckon Mr. Jones
<span id="L8187" class="ln">  8187</span>	was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will
<span id="L8188" class="ln">  8188</span>	drop pretty flat.&#34;
<span id="L8189" class="ln">  8189</span>	
<span id="L8190" class="ln">  8190</span>	Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.
<span id="L8191" class="ln">  8191</span>	
<span id="L8192" class="ln">  8192</span>	&#34;Sid, was it you that told?&#34;
<span id="L8193" class="ln">  8193</span>	
<span id="L8194" class="ln">  8194</span>	&#34;Oh, never mind who it was. SOMEBODY told--that&#39;s enough.&#34;
<span id="L8195" class="ln">  8195</span>	
<span id="L8196" class="ln">  8196</span>	&#34;Sid, there&#39;s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
<span id="L8197" class="ln">  8197</span>	that&#39;s you. If you had been in Huck&#39;s place you&#39;d &#39;a&#39; sneaked down the
<span id="L8198" class="ln">  8198</span>	hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can&#39;t do any but mean
<span id="L8199" class="ln">  8199</span>	things, and you can&#39;t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.
<span id="L8200" class="ln">  8200</span>	There--no thanks, as the widow says&#34;--and Tom cuffed Sid&#39;s ears and
<span id="L8201" class="ln">  8201</span>	helped him to the door with several kicks. &#34;Now go and tell auntie if
<span id="L8202" class="ln">  8202</span>	you dare--and to-morrow you&#39;ll catch it!&#34;
<span id="L8203" class="ln">  8203</span>	
<span id="L8204" class="ln">  8204</span>	Some minutes later the widow&#39;s guests were at the supper-table, and a
<span id="L8205" class="ln">  8205</span>	dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,
<span id="L8206" class="ln">  8206</span>	after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.
<span id="L8207" class="ln">  8207</span>	Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the
<span id="L8208" class="ln">  8208</span>	honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was
<span id="L8209" class="ln">  8209</span>	another person whose modesty--
<span id="L8210" class="ln">  8210</span>	
<span id="L8211" class="ln">  8211</span>	And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck&#39;s share in the
<span id="L8212" class="ln">  8212</span>	adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the
<span id="L8213" class="ln">  8213</span>	surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
<span id="L8214" class="ln">  8214</span>	effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,
<span id="L8215" class="ln">  8215</span>	the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many
<span id="L8216" class="ln">  8216</span>	compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the
<span id="L8217" class="ln">  8217</span>	nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
<span id="L8218" class="ln">  8218</span>	intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody&#39;s gaze
<span id="L8219" class="ln">  8219</span>	and everybody&#39;s laudations.
<span id="L8220" class="ln">  8220</span>	
<span id="L8221" class="ln">  8221</span>	The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have
<span id="L8222" class="ln">  8222</span>	him educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start
<span id="L8223" class="ln">  8223</span>	him in business in a modest way. Tom&#39;s chance was come. He said:
<span id="L8224" class="ln">  8224</span>	
<span id="L8225" class="ln">  8225</span>	&#34;Huck don&#39;t need it. Huck&#39;s rich.&#34;
<span id="L8226" class="ln">  8226</span>	
<span id="L8227" class="ln">  8227</span>	Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
<span id="L8228" class="ln">  8228</span>	back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But
<span id="L8229" class="ln">  8229</span>	the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:
<span id="L8230" class="ln">  8230</span>	
<span id="L8231" class="ln">  8231</span>	&#34;Huck&#39;s got money. Maybe you don&#39;t believe it, but he&#39;s got lots of
<span id="L8232" class="ln">  8232</span>	it. Oh, you needn&#39;t smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a
<span id="L8233" class="ln">  8233</span>	minute.&#34;
<span id="L8234" class="ln">  8234</span>	
<span id="L8235" class="ln">  8235</span>	Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a
<span id="L8236" class="ln">  8236</span>	perplexed interest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.
<span id="L8237" class="ln">  8237</span>	
<span id="L8238" class="ln">  8238</span>	&#34;Sid, what ails Tom?&#34; said Aunt Polly. &#34;He--well, there ain&#39;t ever any
<span id="L8239" class="ln">  8239</span>	making of that boy out. I never--&#34;
<span id="L8240" class="ln">  8240</span>	
<span id="L8241" class="ln">  8241</span>	Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly
<span id="L8242" class="ln">  8242</span>	did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon
<span id="L8243" class="ln">  8243</span>	the table and said:
<span id="L8244" class="ln">  8244</span>	
<span id="L8245" class="ln">  8245</span>	&#34;There--what did I tell you? Half of it&#39;s Huck&#39;s and half of it&#39;s mine!&#34;
<span id="L8246" class="ln">  8246</span>	
<span id="L8247" class="ln">  8247</span>	The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke
<span id="L8248" class="ln">  8248</span>	for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom
<span id="L8249" class="ln">  8249</span>	said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of
<span id="L8250" class="ln">  8250</span>	interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
<span id="L8251" class="ln">  8251</span>	charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:
<span id="L8252" class="ln">  8252</span>	
<span id="L8253" class="ln">  8253</span>	&#34;I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
<span id="L8254" class="ln">  8254</span>	don&#39;t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I&#39;m
<span id="L8255" class="ln">  8255</span>	willing to allow.&#34;
<span id="L8256" class="ln">  8256</span>	
<span id="L8257" class="ln">  8257</span>	The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve
<span id="L8258" class="ln">  8258</span>	thousand dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one
<span id="L8259" class="ln">  8259</span>	time before, though several persons were there who were worth
<span id="L8260" class="ln">  8260</span>	considerably more than that in property.
<span id="L8261" class="ln">  8261</span>	
<span id="L8262" class="ln">  8262</span>	
<span id="L8263" class="ln">  8263</span>	
<span id="L8264" class="ln">  8264</span>	CHAPTER XXXV
<span id="L8265" class="ln">  8265</span>	
<span id="L8266" class="ln">  8266</span>	THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom&#39;s and Huck&#39;s windfall made a
<span id="L8267" class="ln">  8267</span>	mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a
<span id="L8268" class="ln">  8268</span>	sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked
<span id="L8269" class="ln">  8269</span>	about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the
<span id="L8270" class="ln">  8270</span>	citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every
<span id="L8271" class="ln">  8271</span>	&#34;haunted&#34; house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was
<span id="L8272" class="ln">  8272</span>	dissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for
<span id="L8273" class="ln">  8273</span>	hidden treasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic
<span id="L8274" class="ln">  8274</span>	men, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were
<span id="L8275" class="ln">  8275</span>	courted, admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that
<span id="L8276" class="ln">  8276</span>	their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were
<span id="L8277" class="ln">  8277</span>	treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be
<span id="L8278" class="ln">  8278</span>	regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and
<span id="L8279" class="ln">  8279</span>	saying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up
<span id="L8280" class="ln">  8280</span>	and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village
<span id="L8281" class="ln">  8281</span>	paper published biographical sketches of the boys.
<span id="L8282" class="ln">  8282</span>	
<span id="L8283" class="ln">  8283</span>	The Widow Douglas put Huck&#39;s money out at six per cent., and Judge
<span id="L8284" class="ln">  8284</span>	Thatcher did the same with Tom&#39;s at Aunt Polly&#39;s request. Each lad had
<span id="L8285" class="ln">  8285</span>	an income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every week-day
<span id="L8286" class="ln">  8286</span>	in the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got
<span id="L8287" class="ln">  8287</span>	--no, it was what he was promised--he generally couldn&#39;t collect it. A
<span id="L8288" class="ln">  8288</span>	dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in
<span id="L8289" class="ln">  8289</span>	those old simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that
<span id="L8290" class="ln">  8290</span>	matter.
<span id="L8291" class="ln">  8291</span>	
<span id="L8292" class="ln">  8292</span>	Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no
<span id="L8293" class="ln">  8293</span>	commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When
<span id="L8294" class="ln">  8294</span>	Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her
<span id="L8295" class="ln">  8295</span>	whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded
<span id="L8296" class="ln">  8296</span>	grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that
<span id="L8297" class="ln">  8297</span>	whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine
<span id="L8298" class="ln">  8298</span>	outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that
<span id="L8299" class="ln">  8299</span>	was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to
<span id="L8300" class="ln">  8300</span>	breast with George Washington&#39;s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky
<span id="L8301" class="ln">  8301</span>	thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
<span id="L8302" class="ln">  8302</span>	walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight
<span id="L8303" class="ln">  8303</span>	off and told Tom about it.
<span id="L8304" class="ln">  8304</span>	
<span id="L8305" class="ln">  8305</span>	Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
<span id="L8306" class="ln">  8306</span>	day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the
<span id="L8307" class="ln">  8307</span>	National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school
<span id="L8308" class="ln">  8308</span>	in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or
<span id="L8309" class="ln">  8309</span>	both.
<span id="L8310" class="ln">  8310</span>	
<span id="L8311" class="ln">  8311</span>	Huck Finn&#39;s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow
<span id="L8312" class="ln">  8312</span>	Douglas&#39; protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into
<span id="L8313" class="ln">  8313</span>	it, hurled him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he
<span id="L8314" class="ln">  8314</span>	could bear. The widow&#39;s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and
<span id="L8315" class="ln">  8315</span>	brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had
<span id="L8316" class="ln">  8316</span>	not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know
<span id="L8317" class="ln">  8317</span>	for a friend. He had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use
<span id="L8318" class="ln">  8318</span>	napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to
<span id="L8319" class="ln">  8319</span>	church; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in
<span id="L8320" class="ln">  8320</span>	his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of
<span id="L8321" class="ln">  8321</span>	civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.
<span id="L8322" class="ln">  8322</span>	
<span id="L8323" class="ln">  8323</span>	He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up
<span id="L8324" class="ln">  8324</span>	missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
<span id="L8325" class="ln">  8325</span>	great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched
<span id="L8326" class="ln">  8326</span>	high and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third
<span id="L8327" class="ln">  8327</span>	morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads
<span id="L8328" class="ln">  8328</span>	down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found
<span id="L8329" class="ln">  8329</span>	the refugee. Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some
<span id="L8330" class="ln">  8330</span>	stolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with
<span id="L8331" class="ln">  8331</span>	his pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of
<span id="L8332" class="ln">  8332</span>	rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and
<span id="L8333" class="ln">  8333</span>	happy. Tom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been causing,
<span id="L8334" class="ln">  8334</span>	and urged him to go home. Huck&#39;s face lost its tranquil content, and
<span id="L8335" class="ln">  8335</span>	took a melancholy cast. He said:
<span id="L8336" class="ln">  8336</span>	
<span id="L8337" class="ln">  8337</span>	&#34;Don&#39;t talk about it, Tom. I&#39;ve tried it, and it don&#39;t work; it don&#39;t
<span id="L8338" class="ln">  8338</span>	work, Tom. It ain&#39;t for me; I ain&#39;t used to it. The widder&#39;s good to
<span id="L8339" class="ln">  8339</span>	me, and friendly; but I can&#39;t stand them ways. She makes me get up just
<span id="L8340" class="ln">  8340</span>	at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to
<span id="L8341" class="ln">  8341</span>	thunder; she won&#39;t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them
<span id="L8342" class="ln">  8342</span>	blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don&#39;t seem to any air
<span id="L8343" class="ln">  8343</span>	git through &#39;em, somehow; and they&#39;re so rotten nice that I can&#39;t set
<span id="L8344" class="ln">  8344</span>	down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher&#39;s; I hain&#39;t slid on a
<span id="L8345" class="ln">  8345</span>	cellar-door for--well, it &#39;pears to be years; I got to go to church and
<span id="L8346" class="ln">  8346</span>	sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can&#39;t ketch a fly in
<span id="L8347" class="ln">  8347</span>	there, I can&#39;t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by
<span id="L8348" class="ln">  8348</span>	a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything&#39;s
<span id="L8349" class="ln">  8349</span>	so awful reg&#39;lar a body can&#39;t stand it.&#34;
<span id="L8350" class="ln">  8350</span>	
<span id="L8351" class="ln">  8351</span>	&#34;Well, everybody does that way, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L8352" class="ln">  8352</span>	
<span id="L8353" class="ln">  8353</span>	&#34;Tom, it don&#39;t make no difference. I ain&#39;t everybody, and I can&#39;t
<span id="L8354" class="ln">  8354</span>	STAND it. It&#39;s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don&#39;t
<span id="L8355" class="ln">  8355</span>	take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing; I
<span id="L8356" class="ln">  8356</span>	got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern&#39;d if I hain&#39;t got to ask to do
<span id="L8357" class="ln">  8357</span>	everything. Well, I&#39;d got to talk so nice it wasn&#39;t no comfort--I&#39;d got
<span id="L8358" class="ln">  8358</span>	to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in
<span id="L8359" class="ln">  8359</span>	my mouth, or I&#39;d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn&#39;t let me smoke; she
<span id="L8360" class="ln">  8360</span>	wouldn&#39;t let me yell, she wouldn&#39;t let me gape, nor stretch, nor
<span id="L8361" class="ln">  8361</span>	scratch, before folks--&#34; [Then with a spasm of special irritation and
<span id="L8362" class="ln">  8362</span>	injury]--&#34;And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a
<span id="L8363" class="ln">  8363</span>	woman! I HAD to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school&#39;s
<span id="L8364" class="ln">  8364</span>	going to open, and I&#39;d a had to go to it--well, I wouldn&#39;t stand THAT,
<span id="L8365" class="ln">  8365</span>	Tom. Looky here, Tom, being rich ain&#39;t what it&#39;s cracked up to be. It&#39;s
<span id="L8366" class="ln">  8366</span>	just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead
<span id="L8367" class="ln">  8367</span>	all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar&#39;l suits me, and
<span id="L8368" class="ln">  8368</span>	I ain&#39;t ever going to shake &#39;em any more. Tom, I wouldn&#39;t ever got into
<span id="L8369" class="ln">  8369</span>	all this trouble if it hadn&#39;t &#39;a&#39; ben for that money; now you just take
<span id="L8370" class="ln">  8370</span>	my sheer of it along with your&#39;n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not
<span id="L8371" class="ln">  8371</span>	many times, becuz I don&#39;t give a dern for a thing &#39;thout it&#39;s tollable
<span id="L8372" class="ln">  8372</span>	hard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.&#34;
<span id="L8373" class="ln">  8373</span>	
<span id="L8374" class="ln">  8374</span>	&#34;Oh, Huck, you know I can&#39;t do that. &#39;Tain&#39;t fair; and besides if
<span id="L8375" class="ln">  8375</span>	you&#39;ll try this thing just a while longer you&#39;ll come to like it.&#34;
<span id="L8376" class="ln">  8376</span>	
<span id="L8377" class="ln">  8377</span>	&#34;Like it! Yes--the way I&#39;d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long
<span id="L8378" class="ln">  8378</span>	enough. No, Tom, I won&#39;t be rich, and I won&#39;t live in them cussed
<span id="L8379" class="ln">  8379</span>	smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and
<span id="L8380" class="ln">  8380</span>	I&#39;ll stick to &#39;em, too. Blame it all! just as we&#39;d got guns, and a
<span id="L8381" class="ln">  8381</span>	cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to
<span id="L8382" class="ln">  8382</span>	come up and spile it all!&#34;
<span id="L8383" class="ln">  8383</span>	
<span id="L8384" class="ln">  8384</span>	Tom saw his opportunity--
<span id="L8385" class="ln">  8385</span>	
<span id="L8386" class="ln">  8386</span>	&#34;Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain&#39;t going to keep me back from turning
<span id="L8387" class="ln">  8387</span>	robber.&#34;
<span id="L8388" class="ln">  8388</span>	
<span id="L8389" class="ln">  8389</span>	&#34;No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L8390" class="ln">  8390</span>	
<span id="L8391" class="ln">  8391</span>	&#34;Just as dead earnest as I&#39;m sitting here. But Huck, we can&#39;t let you
<span id="L8392" class="ln">  8392</span>	into the gang if you ain&#39;t respectable, you know.&#34;
<span id="L8393" class="ln">  8393</span>	
<span id="L8394" class="ln">  8394</span>	Huck&#39;s joy was quenched.
<span id="L8395" class="ln">  8395</span>	
<span id="L8396" class="ln">  8396</span>	&#34;Can&#39;t let me in, Tom? Didn&#39;t you let me go for a pirate?&#34;
<span id="L8397" class="ln">  8397</span>	
<span id="L8398" class="ln">  8398</span>	&#34;Yes, but that&#39;s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a
<span id="L8399" class="ln">  8399</span>	pirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they&#39;re awful high up
<span id="L8400" class="ln">  8400</span>	in the nobility--dukes and such.&#34;
<span id="L8401" class="ln">  8401</span>	
<span id="L8402" class="ln">  8402</span>	&#34;Now, Tom, hain&#39;t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn&#39;t shet me
<span id="L8403" class="ln">  8403</span>	out, would you, Tom? You wouldn&#39;t do that, now, WOULD you, Tom?&#34;
<span id="L8404" class="ln">  8404</span>	
<span id="L8405" class="ln">  8405</span>	&#34;Huck, I wouldn&#39;t want to, and I DON&#39;T want to--but what would people
<span id="L8406" class="ln">  8406</span>	say? Why, they&#39;d say, &#39;Mph! Tom Sawyer&#39;s Gang! pretty low characters in
<span id="L8407" class="ln">  8407</span>	it!&#39; They&#39;d mean you, Huck. You wouldn&#39;t like that, and I wouldn&#39;t.&#34;
<span id="L8408" class="ln">  8408</span>	
<span id="L8409" class="ln">  8409</span>	Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally
<span id="L8410" class="ln">  8410</span>	he said:
<span id="L8411" class="ln">  8411</span>	
<span id="L8412" class="ln">  8412</span>	&#34;Well, I&#39;ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if
<span id="L8413" class="ln">  8413</span>	I can come to stand it, if you&#39;ll let me b&#39;long to the gang, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L8414" class="ln">  8414</span>	
<span id="L8415" class="ln">  8415</span>	&#34;All right, Huck, it&#39;s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I&#39;ll ask the
<span id="L8416" class="ln">  8416</span>	widow to let up on you a little, Huck.&#34;
<span id="L8417" class="ln">  8417</span>	
<span id="L8418" class="ln">  8418</span>	&#34;Will you, Tom--now will you? That&#39;s good. If she&#39;ll let up on some of
<span id="L8419" class="ln">  8419</span>	the roughest things, I&#39;ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd
<span id="L8420" class="ln">  8420</span>	through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?&#34;
<span id="L8421" class="ln">  8421</span>	
<span id="L8422" class="ln">  8422</span>	&#34;Oh, right off. We&#39;ll get the boys together and have the initiation
<span id="L8423" class="ln">  8423</span>	to-night, maybe.&#34;
<span id="L8424" class="ln">  8424</span>	
<span id="L8425" class="ln">  8425</span>	&#34;Have the which?&#34;
<span id="L8426" class="ln">  8426</span>	
<span id="L8427" class="ln">  8427</span>	&#34;Have the initiation.&#34;
<span id="L8428" class="ln">  8428</span>	
<span id="L8429" class="ln">  8429</span>	&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;
<span id="L8430" class="ln">  8430</span>	
<span id="L8431" class="ln">  8431</span>	&#34;It&#39;s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang&#39;s
<span id="L8432" class="ln">  8432</span>	secrets, even if you&#39;re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and
<span id="L8433" class="ln">  8433</span>	all his family that hurts one of the gang.&#34;
<span id="L8434" class="ln">  8434</span>	
<span id="L8435" class="ln">  8435</span>	&#34;That&#39;s gay--that&#39;s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.&#34;
<span id="L8436" class="ln">  8436</span>	
<span id="L8437" class="ln">  8437</span>	&#34;Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing&#39;s got to be done at
<span id="L8438" class="ln">  8438</span>	midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha&#39;nted
<span id="L8439" class="ln">  8439</span>	house is the best, but they&#39;re all ripped up now.&#34;
<span id="L8440" class="ln">  8440</span>	
<span id="L8441" class="ln">  8441</span>	&#34;Well, midnight&#39;s good, anyway, Tom.&#34;
<span id="L8442" class="ln">  8442</span>	
<span id="L8443" class="ln">  8443</span>	&#34;Yes, so it is. And you&#39;ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with
<span id="L8444" class="ln">  8444</span>	blood.&#34;
<span id="L8445" class="ln">  8445</span>	
<span id="L8446" class="ln">  8446</span>	&#34;Now, that&#39;s something LIKE! Why, it&#39;s a million times bullier than
<span id="L8447" class="ln">  8447</span>	pirating. I&#39;ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be
<span id="L8448" class="ln">  8448</span>	a reg&#39;lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking &#39;bout it, I reckon
<span id="L8449" class="ln">  8449</span>	she&#39;ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.&#34;
<span id="L8450" class="ln">  8450</span>	
<span id="L8451" class="ln">  8451</span>	
<span id="L8452" class="ln">  8452</span>	
<span id="L8453" class="ln">  8453</span>	CONCLUSION
<span id="L8454" class="ln">  8454</span>	
<span id="L8455" class="ln">  8455</span>	SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a BOY, it
<span id="L8456" class="ln">  8456</span>	must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming
<span id="L8457" class="ln">  8457</span>	the history of a MAN. When one writes a novel about grown people, he
<span id="L8458" class="ln">  8458</span>	knows exactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he
<span id="L8459" class="ln">  8459</span>	writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best can.
<span id="L8460" class="ln">  8460</span>	
<span id="L8461" class="ln">  8461</span>	Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are
<span id="L8462" class="ln">  8462</span>	prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the
<span id="L8463" class="ln">  8463</span>	story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they
<span id="L8464" class="ln">  8464</span>	turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that
<span id="L8465" class="ln">  8465</span>	part of their lives at present.
