<span id="L6" class="ln">     6	</span>Package signal implements access to incoming signals.
<span id="L7" class="ln">     7	</span>
<span id="L8" class="ln">     8	</span>Signals are primarily used on Unix-like systems. For the use of this
<span id="L9" class="ln">     9	</span>package on Windows and Plan 9, see below.
<span id="L10" class="ln">    10	</span>
<span id="L11" class="ln">    11	</span>Types of signals
<span id="L12" class="ln">    12	</span>
<span id="L13" class="ln">    13	</span>The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP may not be caught by a program, and
<span id="L14" class="ln">    14	</span>therefore cannot be affected by this package.
<span id="L15" class="ln">    15	</span>
<span id="L16" class="ln">    16	</span>Synchronous signals are signals triggered by errors in program
<span id="L17" class="ln">    17	</span>execution: SIGBUS, SIGFPE, and SIGSEGV. These are only considered
<span id="L18" class="ln">    18	</span>synchronous when caused by program execution, not when sent using
<span id="L19" class="ln">    19	</span>os.Process.Kill or the kill program or some similar mechanism. In
<span id="L20" class="ln">    20	</span>general, except as discussed below, Go programs will convert a
<span id="L21" class="ln">    21	</span>synchronous signal into a run-time panic.
<span id="L22" class="ln">    22	</span>
<span id="L23" class="ln">    23	</span>The remaining signals are asynchronous signals. They are not
<span id="L24" class="ln">    24	</span>triggered by program errors, but are instead sent from the kernel or
<span id="L25" class="ln">    25	</span>from some other program.
<span id="L26" class="ln">    26	</span>
<span id="L27" class="ln">    27	</span>Of the asynchronous signals, the SIGHUP signal is sent when a program
<span id="L28" class="ln">    28	</span>loses its controlling terminal. The SIGINT signal is sent when the
<span id="L29" class="ln">    29	</span>user at the controlling terminal presses the interrupt character,
<span id="L30" class="ln">    30	</span>which by default is ^C (Control-C). The SIGQUIT signal is sent when
<span id="L31" class="ln">    31	</span>the user at the controlling terminal presses the quit character, which
<span id="L32" class="ln">    32	</span>by default is ^\ (Control-Backslash). In general you can cause a
<span id="L33" class="ln">    33	</span>program to simply exit by pressing ^C, and you can cause it to exit
<span id="L34" class="ln">    34	</span>with a stack dump by pressing ^\.
<span id="L35" class="ln">    35	</span>
<span id="L36" class="ln">    36	</span>Default behavior of signals in Go programs
<span id="L37" class="ln">    37	</span>
<span id="L38" class="ln">    38	</span>By default, a synchronous signal is converted into a run-time panic. A
<span id="L39" class="ln">    39	</span>SIGHUP, SIGINT, or SIGTERM signal causes the program to exit. A
<span id="L40" class="ln">    40	</span>SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGTRAP, SIGABRT, SIGSTKFLT, SIGEMT, or SIGSYS signal
<span id="L41" class="ln">    41	</span>causes the program to exit with a stack dump. A SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or
<span id="L42" class="ln">    42	</span>SIGTTOU signal gets the system default behavior (these signals are
<span id="L43" class="ln">    43	</span>used by the shell for job control). The SIGPROF signal is handled
<span id="L44" class="ln">    44	</span>directly by the Go runtime to implement runtime.CPUProfile. Other
<span id="L45" class="ln">    45	</span>signals will be caught but no action will be taken.
<span id="L46" class="ln">    46	</span>
<span id="L47" class="ln">    47	</span>If the Go program is started with either SIGHUP or SIGINT ignored
<span id="L48" class="ln">    48	</span>(signal handler set to SIG_IGN), they will remain ignored.
<span id="L49" class="ln">    49	</span>
<span id="L50" class="ln">    50	</span>If the Go program is started with a non-empty signal mask, that will
<span id="L51" class="ln">    51	</span>generally be honored. However, some signals are explicitly unblocked:
<span id="L52" class="ln">    52	</span>the synchronous signals, SIGILL, SIGTRAP, SIGSTKFLT, SIGCHLD, SIGPROF,
<span id="L53" class="ln">    53	</span>and, on GNU/Linux, signals 32 (SIGCANCEL) and 33 (SIGSETXID)
<span id="L54" class="ln">    54	</span>(SIGCANCEL and SIGSETXID are used internally by glibc). Subprocesses
<span id="L55" class="ln">    55	</span>started by os.Exec, or by the os/exec package, will inherit the
<span id="L56" class="ln">    56	</span>modified signal mask.
<span id="L57" class="ln">    57	</span>
<span id="L58" class="ln">    58	</span>Changing the behavior of signals in Go programs
<span id="L59" class="ln">    59	</span>
<span id="L60" class="ln">    60	</span>The functions in this package allow a program to change the way Go
<span id="L61" class="ln">    61	</span>programs handle signals.
<span id="L62" class="ln">    62	</span>
<span id="L63" class="ln">    63	</span>Notify disables the default behavior for a given set of asynchronous
<span id="L64" class="ln">    64	</span>signals and instead delivers them over one or more registered
<span id="L65" class="ln">    65	</span>channels. Specifically, it applies to the signals SIGHUP, SIGINT,
<span id="L66" class="ln">    66	</span>SIGQUIT, SIGABRT, and SIGTERM. It also applies to the job control
<span id="L67" class="ln">    67	</span>signals SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU, in which case the system
<span id="L68" class="ln">    68	</span>default behavior does not occur. It also applies to some signals that
<span id="L69" class="ln">    69	</span>otherwise cause no action: SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM,
<span id="L70" class="ln">    70	</span>SIGCHLD, SIGCONT, SIGURG, SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ, SIGVTALRM, SIGWINCH,
<span id="L71" class="ln">    71	</span>SIGIO, SIGPWR, SIGSYS, SIGINFO, SIGTHR, SIGWAITING, SIGLWP, SIGFREEZE,
<span id="L72" class="ln">    72	</span>SIGTHAW, SIGLOST, SIGXRES, SIGJVM1, SIGJVM2, and any real time signals
<span id="L73" class="ln">    73	</span>used on the system. Note that not all of these signals are available
<span id="L74" class="ln">    74	</span>on all systems.
<span id="L75" class="ln">    75	</span>
<span id="L76" class="ln">    76	</span>If the program was started with SIGHUP or SIGINT ignored, and Notify
<span id="L77" class="ln">    77	</span>is called for either signal, a signal handler will be installed for
<span id="L78" class="ln">    78	</span>that signal and it will no longer be ignored. If, later, Reset or
<span id="L79" class="ln">    79	</span>Ignore is called for that signal, or Stop is called on all channels
<span id="L80" class="ln">    80	</span>passed to Notify for that signal, the signal will once again be
<span id="L81" class="ln">    81	</span>ignored. Reset will restore the system default behavior for the
<span id="L82" class="ln">    82	</span>signal, while Ignore will cause the system to ignore the signal
<span id="L83" class="ln">    83	</span>entirely.
<span id="L84" class="ln">    84	</span>
<span id="L85" class="ln">    85	</span>If the program is started with a non-empty signal mask, some signals
<span id="L86" class="ln">    86	</span>will be explicitly unblocked as described above. If Notify is called
<span id="L87" class="ln">    87	</span>for a blocked signal, it will be unblocked. If, later, Reset is
<span id="L88" class="ln">    88	</span>called for that signal, or Stop is called on all channels passed to
<span id="L89" class="ln">    89	</span>Notify for that signal, the signal will once again be blocked.
<span id="L90" class="ln">    90	</span>
<span id="L91" class="ln">    91	</span>SIGPIPE
<span id="L92" class="ln">    92	</span>
<span id="L93" class="ln">    93	</span>When a Go program writes to a broken pipe, the kernel will raise a
<span id="L94" class="ln">    94	</span>SIGPIPE signal.
<span id="L95" class="ln">    95	</span>
<span id="L96" class="ln">    96	</span>If the program has not called Notify to receive SIGPIPE signals, then
<span id="L97" class="ln">    97	</span>the behavior depends on the file descriptor number. A write to a
<span id="L98" class="ln">    98	</span>broken pipe on file descriptors 1 or 2 (standard output or standard
<span id="L99" class="ln">    99	</span>error) will cause the program to exit with a SIGPIPE signal. A write
<span id="L100" class="ln">   100	</span>to a broken pipe on some other file descriptor will take no action on
<span id="L101" class="ln">   101	</span>the SIGPIPE signal, and the write will fail with an EPIPE error.
<span id="L102" class="ln">   102	</span>
<span id="L103" class="ln">   103	</span>If the program has called Notify to receive SIGPIPE signals, the file
<span id="L104" class="ln">   104	</span>descriptor number does not matter. The SIGPIPE signal will be
<span id="L105" class="ln">   105	</span>delivered to the Notify channel, and the write will fail with an EPIPE
<span id="L106" class="ln">   106	</span>error.
<span id="L107" class="ln">   107	</span>
<span id="L108" class="ln">   108	</span>This means that, by default, command line programs will behave like
<span id="L109" class="ln">   109	</span>typical Unix command line programs, while other programs will not
<span id="L110" class="ln">   110	</span>crash with SIGPIPE when writing to a closed network connection.
<span id="L111" class="ln">   111	</span>
<span id="L112" class="ln">   112	</span>Go programs that use cgo or SWIG
<span id="L113" class="ln">   113	</span>
<span id="L114" class="ln">   114	</span>In a Go program that includes non-Go code, typically C/C++ code
<span id="L115" class="ln">   115	</span>accessed using cgo or SWIG, Go&#39;s startup code normally runs first. It
<span id="L116" class="ln">   116	</span>configures the signal handlers as expected by the Go runtime, before
<span id="L117" class="ln">   117	</span>the non-Go startup code runs. If the non-Go startup code wishes to
<span id="L118" class="ln">   118	</span>install its own signal handlers, it must take certain steps to keep Go
<span id="L119" class="ln">   119	</span>working well. This section documents those steps and the overall
<span id="L120" class="ln">   120	</span>effect changes to signal handler settings by the non-Go code can have
<span id="L121" class="ln">   121	</span>on Go programs. In rare cases, the non-Go code may run before the Go
<span id="L122" class="ln">   122	</span>code, in which case the next section also applies.
<span id="L123" class="ln">   123	</span>
<span id="L124" class="ln">   124	</span>If the non-Go code called by the Go program does not change any signal
<span id="L125" class="ln">   125	</span>handlers or masks, then the behavior is the same as for a pure Go
<span id="L126" class="ln">   126	</span>program.
<span id="L127" class="ln">   127	</span>
<span id="L128" class="ln">   128	</span>If the non-Go code installs any signal handlers, it must use the
<span id="L129" class="ln">   129	</span>SA_ONSTACK flag with sigaction. Failing to do so is likely to cause
<span id="L130" class="ln">   130	</span>the program to crash if the signal is received. Go programs routinely
<span id="L131" class="ln">   131	</span>run with a limited stack, and therefore set up an alternate signal
<span id="L132" class="ln">   132	</span>stack. Also, the Go standard library expects that any signal handlers
<span id="L133" class="ln">   133	</span>will use the SA_RESTART flag. Failing to do so may cause some library
<span id="L134" class="ln">   134	</span>calls to return &#34;interrupted system call&#34; errors.
<span id="L135" class="ln">   135	</span>
<span id="L136" class="ln">   136	</span>If the non-Go code installs a signal handler for any of the
<span id="L137" class="ln">   137	</span>synchronous signals (SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV), then it should record
<span id="L138" class="ln">   138	</span>the existing Go signal handler. If those signals occur while
<span id="L139" class="ln">   139	</span>executing Go code, it should invoke the Go signal handler (whether the
<span id="L140" class="ln">   140	</span>signal occurs while executing Go code can be determined by looking at
<span id="L141" class="ln">   141	</span>the PC passed to the signal handler). Otherwise some Go run-time
<span id="L142" class="ln">   142	</span>panics will not occur as expected.
<span id="L143" class="ln">   143	</span>
<span id="L144" class="ln">   144	</span>If the non-Go code installs a signal handler for any of the
<span id="L145" class="ln">   145	</span>asynchronous signals, it may invoke the Go signal handler or not as it
<span id="L146" class="ln">   146	</span>chooses. Naturally, if it does not invoke the Go signal handler, the
<span id="L147" class="ln">   147	</span>Go behavior described above will not occur. This can be an issue with
<span id="L148" class="ln">   148	</span>the SIGPROF signal in particular.
<span id="L149" class="ln">   149	</span>
<span id="L150" class="ln">   150	</span>The non-Go code should not change the signal mask on any threads
<span id="L151" class="ln">   151	</span>created by the Go runtime. If the non-Go code starts new threads of
<span id="L152" class="ln">   152	</span>its own, it may set the signal mask as it pleases.
<span id="L153" class="ln">   153	</span>
<span id="L154" class="ln">   154	</span>If the non-Go code starts a new thread, changes the signal mask, and
<span id="L155" class="ln">   155	</span>then invokes a Go function in that thread, the Go runtime will
<span id="L156" class="ln">   156	</span>automatically unblock certain signals: the synchronous signals,
<span id="L157" class="ln">   157	</span>SIGILL, SIGTRAP, SIGSTKFLT, SIGCHLD, SIGPROF, SIGCANCEL, and
<span id="L158" class="ln">   158	</span>SIGSETXID. When the Go function returns, the non-Go signal mask will
<span id="L159" class="ln">   159	</span>be restored.
<span id="L160" class="ln">   160	</span>
<span id="L161" class="ln">   161	</span>If the Go signal handler is invoked on a non-Go thread not running Go
<span id="L162" class="ln">   162	</span>code, the handler generally forwards the signal to the non-Go code, as
<span id="L163" class="ln">   163	</span>follows. If the signal is SIGPROF, the Go handler does
<span id="L164" class="ln">   164	</span>nothing. Otherwise, the Go handler removes itself, unblocks the
<span id="L165" class="ln">   165	</span>signal, and raises it again, to invoke any non-Go handler or default
<span id="L166" class="ln">   166	</span>system handler. If the program does not exit, the Go handler then
<span id="L167" class="ln">   167	</span>reinstalls itself and continues execution of the program.
<span id="L168" class="ln">   168	</span>
<span id="L169" class="ln">   169	</span>Non-Go programs that call Go code
<span id="L170" class="ln">   170	</span>
<span id="L171" class="ln">   171	</span>When Go code is built with options like -buildmode=c-shared, it will
<span id="L172" class="ln">   172	</span>be run as part of an existing non-Go program. The non-Go code may
<span id="L173" class="ln">   173	</span>have already installed signal handlers when the Go code starts (that
<span id="L174" class="ln">   174	</span>may also happen in unusual cases when using cgo or SWIG; in that case,
<span id="L175" class="ln">   175	</span>the discussion here applies).  For -buildmode=c-archive the Go runtime
<span id="L176" class="ln">   176	</span>will initialize signals at global constructor time.  For
<span id="L177" class="ln">   177	</span>-buildmode=c-shared the Go runtime will initialize signals when the
<span id="L178" class="ln">   178	</span>shared library is loaded.
<span id="L179" class="ln">   179	</span>
<span id="L180" class="ln">   180	</span>If the Go runtime sees an existing signal handler for the SIGCANCEL or
<span id="L181" class="ln">   181	</span>SIGSETXID signals (which are used only on GNU/Linux), it will turn on
<span id="L182" class="ln">   182	</span>the SA_ONSTACK flag and otherwise keep the signal handler.
<span id="L183" class="ln">   183	</span>
<span id="L184" class="ln">   184	</span>For the synchronous signals, the Go runtime will install a signal
<span id="L185" class="ln">   185	</span>handler. It will save any existing signal handler. If a synchronous
<span id="L186" class="ln">   186	</span>signal arrives while executing non-Go code, the Go runtime will invoke
<span id="L187" class="ln">   187	</span>the existing signal handler instead of the Go signal handler.
<span id="L188" class="ln">   188	</span>
<span id="L189" class="ln">   189	</span>Go code built with -buildmode=c-archive or -buildmode=c-shared will
<span id="L190" class="ln">   190	</span>not install any other signal handlers by default. If there is an
<span id="L191" class="ln">   191	</span>existing signal handler, the Go runtime will turn on the SA_ONSTACK
<span id="L192" class="ln">   192	</span>flag and otherwise keep the signal handler. If Notify is called for an
<span id="L193" class="ln">   193	</span>asynchronous signal, a Go signal handler will be installed for that
<span id="L194" class="ln">   194	</span>signal. If, later, Reset is called for that signal, the original
<span id="L195" class="ln">   195	</span>handling for that signal will be reinstalled, restoring the non-Go
<span id="L196" class="ln">   196	</span>signal handler if any.
<span id="L197" class="ln">   197	</span>
<span id="L198" class="ln">   198	</span>Go code built without -buildmode=c-archive or -buildmode=c-shared will
<span id="L199" class="ln">   199	</span>install a signal handler for the asynchronous signals listed above,
<span id="L200" class="ln">   200	</span>and save any existing signal handler. If a signal is delivered to a
<span id="L201" class="ln">   201	</span>non-Go thread, it will act as described above, except that if there is
<span id="L202" class="ln">   202	</span>an existing non-Go signal handler, that handler will be installed
<span id="L203" class="ln">   203	</span>before raising the signal.
